# Docker

While not suitable for production deployments, it is possible to run StorageOS
in a standalone [DockerCE](https://www.docker.com) container, and provide
permanent storage for other containers. This can be useful for testing and
experimentation with our product.

Please note that StorageOS support for DockerEE is coming soon.
