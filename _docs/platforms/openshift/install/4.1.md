Installing StorageOS on OpenShift {{ page.oc-version }} has fewer prerequisites
as compared to previous OpenShift 3.x versions.

The recommended way to run StorageOS on OpenShift {{ page.oc-version }} is to
deploy the StorageOS Cluster Operator using the OperatorHub and bootstrap
StorageOS using a Custom Resource.

Options:
- [OperatorHub (Recommended)](#operatorhub-install)
- [Manual install](#manual-install)


## OperatorHub install

StorageOS has a RedHat OpenShift certified operator in the OpenShift
OperatorHub. You can install the StorageOS operator through the OperatorHub.

1. Select the `OperatorHub` from the Catalog sub menu and search for StorageOS

1. Select StorageOS and click install

1. Create the Operator subscription by clicking subscribe

1. Wait until the Upgrade Status shows 1 installed

1. Create a secret containing an `apiUsername` and an `apiPassword` key. The
   username and password defined in the secret will be used to authenticate
   when using the StorageOS CLI and GUI. Take note of which project you created
   the secret in.

1. Go to `Installed Operators` and select the StorageOS operator. Select
   StorageOS Cluster and create a StorageOS cluster.

    ![install-7](/images/openshift4/create-stos.png)

1. The StorageOS cluster resource describes the StorageOS cluster that will be
   created. The `secretRefName` and `secretRefNamespace` should reference the secret
   containing the `apiUsername` and `apiPassword` that was previously created.

   Additional `spec` parameters are available on the [Cluster Operator
   configuration](/docs/reference/cluster-operator/configuration) page.

   ```bash
	apiVersion: storageos.com/v1
	kind: StorageOSCluster
	metadata:
	  name: storageos
	  namespace: openshift-operators
	spec:
	  secretRefName: "storageos-api" # Reference the Secret created in the previous step
	  secretRefNamespace: "openshift-operators"  # Namespace of the Secret created in the previous step
	  namespace: kube-system
	  csi:
	    enable: true
	    deploymentStrategy: deployment
	  resources:
	    requests:
	    memory: "512Mi"
	  k8sDistro: "openshift"
   ```

    ![install-8](/images/openshift4/stos-specs.png)


1. Verify that the StorageOS Resource enters a running state.

&nbsp;
If this is your first installation you may wish to follow the [StorageOS
Volume guide](/docs/platforms/{{ page.platform }}/firstvolume/) for an example of how
to mount a StorageOS volume in a Pod.
