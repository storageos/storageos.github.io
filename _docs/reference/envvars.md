# Environment Variables

Several aspects of StorageOS behaviour can be controlled via environment
variables. These can be injected in via any of the usual mechanisms such as
[ConfigMaps](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/).

| Variable Name             | Valid in versions | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| `CSI_VERSION`             | 1.1.0+            | Added in `1.1.0` to define what version of CSI to use. Can be set to `v0` or `v1`, defaults to `v0`                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `PROBE_INTERVAL`          | 1.1.2+            | The interval between node probes. Takes a time duration in string format e.g. `500ms` or `2s`. Setting this lower (more frequent) will cause the cluster to detect failed nodes more quickly at the expense of increased bandwidth usage.  Defaults to 1000ms. Added in `1.1.2` replacing `PROBE_INTERVAL_MS` |
| `PROBE_INTERVAL_MS`       | 1.1.1             | The interval in milliseconds between node probes. Setting this lower (more frequent) will cause the cluster to detect failed nodes more quickly at the expense of increased bandwidth usage.  Defaults to 1000ms. Added in `1.1.1` and deprecated in `1.1.2` See `PROBE_INTERVAL`                             |
| `PROBE_TIMEOUT`           | 1.1.2+            | The timeout to wait for an ack from a probed node before assuming it is unhealthy.  Takes a time duration in string format e.g. `500ms` or `2s`. This should be set to 99-percentile of RTT (round-trip time) on your network.  Defaults to 3000ms. Added in `1.1.2` replacing `PROBE_TIMEOUT_MS`             |
