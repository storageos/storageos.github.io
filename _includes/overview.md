# StorageOS Documentation

This documentation is aimed at architects, engineers, developers, sysadmins and
anybody who wants to understand how to use StorageOS. It assumes some knowledge
of Docker containers and container orchestrators.

1. Start by [understanding the architecture]({% link
_docs/concepts/architecture.md %}) and [playing with a demo](http://play.storageos.com/main).

1. Once you are ready to install into your environment follow the
installation guides for [Kubernetes]({% link _docs/platforms/kubernetes/install-1.10.md %}),
[OpenShift]({% link _docs/platforms/openshift/install-3.8.md %}) or [Docker]({% link
_docs/platforms/docker/install.md %}).

1. When you want to run StorageOS in production, read about [best practices]({% link
