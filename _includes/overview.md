# StorageOS Documentation

This documentation is aimed at architects, DevOps engineers, developers,
sysadmins and anybody who wants to understand how to use StorageOS. It assumes
some knowledge of Docker containers and orchestrators.


## Getting Started

1. Start by [understanding the architecture]({% link
_docs/concepts/architecture.md %}) and [playing with a demo](http://play.storageos.com/main).

1. Once you are ready to install into your environment, make sure the [prerequisites are
fulfilled]({% link _docs/introduction/quickstart.md %}) and then follow the
installation guides for [Kubernetes]({% link _docs/platforms/kubernetes/install-1.10.md %}),
[OpenShift]({% link _docs/platforms/openshift/install-3.8.md %}) or [Docker]({% link
_docs/platforms/docker/install.md %}). Note that we provide platform-specific
documentation under the 'Platforms' heading, and additional platform-agnostic
documentation under 'Operations'.

1. When you want to run StorageOS in production, read about [best practices]({% link
_docs/concepts/production.md %}).
