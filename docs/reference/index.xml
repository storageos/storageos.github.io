      <title>Docs: Command line interface</title>
      <link>https://docs.storageos.com/docs/reference/cli/</link>

        &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;storageos&lt;/code&gt; command line interface (CLI) is used to manage cluster-wide
configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is highly recommended to install the CLI, since it can be used to generate a
lot of useful information about your StorageOS cluster and significantly speed
up resolution times for support issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;installation&#34;&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8f5902;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;# linux/amd64&lt;/span&gt;
curl -sSLo storageos &lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;\ &lt;/span&gt;
    https://github.com/storageos/go-cli/releases/download/v2.4.2/storageos_linux_amd64 &lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ce5c00;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; chmod +x storageos &lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ce5c00;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; sudo mv storageos /usr/local/bin/

&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8f5902;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;# MacOS&lt;/span&gt;
curl -sSLo storageos &lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    https://github.com/storageos/go-cli/releases/download/v2.4.2/storageos_darwin_amd64 &lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ce5c00;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; chmod +x storageos &lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ce5c00;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; sudo mv storageos /usr/local/bin/
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will need to provide the correct credentials to connect to the API. The
default installation uses the &lt;code&gt;storageos-api&lt;/code&gt; Secret to generate the first
admin user. By default, it creates a single user with username &lt;code&gt;storageos&lt;/code&gt; and
password &lt;code&gt;storageos&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#204a87&#34;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#000&#34;&gt;STORAGEOS_USERNAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ce5c00;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;storageos
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#204a87&#34;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#000&#34;&gt;STORAGEOS_PASSWORD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ce5c00;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;storageos
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#204a87&#34;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#000&#34;&gt;STORAGEOS_ENDPOINTS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ce5c00;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;10.1.5.249:5705
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;run-the-cli-as-a-deployment-in-your-cluster&#34;&gt;Run the CLI as a deployment in your cluster&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a preferred installation method, since our support bundle generation
software can automatically detect a deployment called &amp;ldquo;cli&amp;rdquo; and warn you if you
do not have the CLI installed. You can run CLI commands with &lt;code&gt;kubectl exec&lt;/code&gt; on
your cli container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;kubectl apply -f&lt;/code&gt; the below YAML manifest to install.&lt;/p&gt;

      restartPolicy: Always
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;run-cli-as-a-container&#34;&gt;Run CLI as a container&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also run the cli as a container in your Kubernetes cluster. Then exec
into it to run commands.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Docs: Cluster Operator</title>
      <link>https://docs.storageos.com/docs/reference/cluster-operator/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;Our cluster operator is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/extend-cluster/&#34;&gt;Kubernetes native
application&lt;/a&gt;
developed to deploy and configure StorageOS clusters, and assist with
maintenance operations. We recommend its use for standard installations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The operator acts as a Kubernetes controller that watches the &lt;code&gt;StorageOSCluster&lt;/code&gt;
CR (Custom Resource). Once the controller is ready, a StorageOS cluster definition can be
created. The operator will deploy a StorageOS cluster based on the
configuration specified in the cluster definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find the source code in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/storageos/cluster-operator&#34;&gt;cluster-operator
repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install the operator following orchestrator specific procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To deploy a StorageOS cluster you will need to fulfil the following steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install Etcd&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install operator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create &lt;code&gt;storageos-api&lt;/code&gt; Secret&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a CR (Custom Resource) to deploy StorageOS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Docs: Encryption</title>
      <link>https://docs.storageos.com/docs/reference/encryption/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://docs.storageos.com/docs/reference/encryption/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;StorageOS supports encryption for data-at-rest and data-in-transit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data-in-transit is data as it is travelling between nodes. It is encrypted by
default with mTLS. Data-at-rest is the data stored in your volumes as &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/docs/concepts/volumes/&#34;&gt; blob
files&lt;/a&gt;. Encryption of these blob files
is optional and can be enabled by adding a label to your volume definitions
before they&amp;rsquo;re provisioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For information on how to enable encryption on your volumes, please see our
&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/docs/operations/encryption/&#34;&gt;Encryption Operations&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-volumes-are-encrypted&#34;&gt;How volumes are encrypted&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volumes are encrypted using AES-256 in the XTS-AES mode with 512-bit keys, as
specified by IEEE Standard 1619-2007. There is a non-zero performance impact of
using encrypted volumes. A 10-25% cost in read/write throughput can be
expected from XTS-AES, dependent on workload. Thin provisioning still applies
to encrypted volumes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;encryption-key-generation&#34;&gt;Encryption Key Generation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On PVC creation, &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/docs/reference/labels/#storageos-volume-labels&#34;&gt;if encryption is enabled&lt;/a&gt;, StorageOS will
automatically generate up to two keys as Kubernetes secrets. Both keys are
stored in the same namespace as the PVC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t already exist, a namespace key is generated. It is
always named &lt;code&gt;storageos-namespace-key&lt;/code&gt; and only one exists per namespace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly a volume key is created for each encrypted volume. It has a name in
the format &lt;code&gt;storageos-volume-key-&amp;lt;random-id&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, with no connection to the name
of the volume. The volume it is associated with can be determined by looking at
the &lt;code&gt;storageos.com/pvc&lt;/code&gt; label on the secret. The
&lt;code&gt;storageos.com/encryption-secret-name&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;storageos.com/encryption-secret-namespace&lt;/code&gt; annotations are added to the PVC by
an admission controller to map the PVC back to its secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The encryption key is passed to StorageOS as part of the CSI volume creation
request and is used to encrypt the volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;encryption-key-use&#34;&gt;Encryption Key Use&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The volume specific secret is needed whenever a volume is attached to a node
for use by a pod. When this happens, the StorageOS node container&amp;rsquo;s Service
Account reads the secret and passes it to the StorageOS controlplane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A volume missing its key or with a malformed key will be unable to attach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key is stored in memory by StorageOS only on the node that the volume is
being used on. As a result, encryption and decryption are performed where the
data is consumed, rather than where it is stored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this, the use of encrypted volumes is transparent to the user.
There is a complete integration between Kubernetes applications and
StorageOS encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;key-management-best-practices&#34;&gt;Key Management Best Practices&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;StorageOS does not store encryption keys outside of Kubernetes secrets.
Backups are therefore imperative in case the Kubernetes etcd is lost.
&lt;strong&gt;StorageOS has no ability to decrypt a volume whose encryption keys have been
lost.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secrets in Kubernetes are not encrypted by default, they are stored in the
Kubernetes etcd in simple Base64 encoding. As StorageOS encryption keys are
stored as Kubernetes Secrets, this means that anyone with access to a
Kubernetes etcd installation can read encryption keys and decrypt encrypted
volumes, unless the cluster has an external secrets store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For better security &lt;a href=&#34;https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/encrypt-data/&#34;&gt;secret
encryption&lt;/a&gt;
or an access control system such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vaultproject.io&#34;&gt;Vault&lt;/a&gt; should
be in operation on production-grade or sensitive clusters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secrets are not garbage-collected by StorageOS. To clean up completely upon
deletion of a volume it is necessary to also delete that volume&amp;rsquo;s secret. There
is no benefit to doing this, however.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;StorageOS provides a GUI for cluster and volume management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GUI is available at port 5705 on any of the nodes in the cluster. Initially
you can log in as the default administrator, with the username and password
from the &lt;code&gt;storageos-api&lt;/code&gt; Secret. By default &lt;code&gt;storageos&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;storageos&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can access the GUI by either port-forwarding with kubectl or using an
Ingress rule. i.e &lt;code&gt;kubectl -n kube-system port-forward svc/storageos 5705&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Docs: Init container</title>
      <link>https://docs.storageos.com/docs/reference/init-container/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://docs.storageos.com/docs/reference/init-container/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;StorageOS has requirements for the configuration of host systems. As such,
StorageOS starts an init container that sets the system configuration for
StorageOS. The container also manages configuration changes required when
upgrading StorageOS versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The container belongs to the DaemonSet that the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/docs/reference/cluster-operator/&#34;&gt;StorageOS Cluster
Operator&lt;/a&gt; starts when a
&lt;code&gt;StorageOSCluster&lt;/code&gt; resource is created. The &lt;code&gt;storageos-init&lt;/code&gt; container is
executed as an
&lt;a href=&#34;https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/&#34;&gt;initContainer&lt;/a&gt;
as part of a Kubernetes Pod. Therefore, only successful execution of the
&lt;code&gt;storageos-init&lt;/code&gt; container processes will result in the main container
starting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;script-framework&#34;&gt;Script Framework&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code responsible for fulfilling the requirements is based on a Script
Framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The script framework executes a set of scripts, performing checks,
verifications and other procedures needed for StorageOS to be able to start.
The scripts stdout and stderr are written to the stdout and stderr of the init
app. The container logs contain all the logs of the individual scripts that
run. The exit statuses of the scripts are used to determine initialization
failure or success. Any non-zero exit status is logged as an event in the
Kubernetes Pod events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If any of the scripts fail, the &lt;code&gt;storageos-init&lt;/code&gt; container will propagate the
failure to Kubernetes, showing the status of the Pod as &lt;code&gt;Init:Err&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To view the output of all &lt;code&gt;storageos-init&lt;/code&gt; containers the following command can
be used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;kubectl -n kube-system logs -l &lt;span style=&#34;color:#000&#34;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ce5c00;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;storageos,kind&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ce5c00;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;daemonset -c storageos-init
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more details, check the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/storageos/init&#34;&gt;StorageOS init container project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;scripts-executed&#34;&gt;Scripts executed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;storageos-init&lt;/code&gt; container executes the following scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/storageos/init/tree/master/scripts/01-lio&#34;&gt;enable-lio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/storageos/init/tree/master/scripts/10-dbupgrade-v1v2&#34;&gt;dbupgrade&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Docs: Kubernetes Object Sync</title>
      <link>https://docs.storageos.com/docs/reference/kubernetes-object-sync/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://docs.storageos.com/docs/reference/kubernetes-object-sync/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;The below controllers are part of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/docs/concepts/components/&#34;&gt;StorageOS API manager&lt;/a&gt;, and handle a variety of cases where
information about Kubernetes objects from your cluster needs to be synced to
your StorageOS cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CSI Driver annotation mentioned below is added to your PVC or Node
automatically by StorageOS and is not removed. It is set by default in the case
of a PVC &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/docs/operations/storageclasses/&#34;&gt;StorageClass&lt;/a&gt; or
PVC&amp;rsquo;s StorageClassName parameter, or in the case of a node, by the node driver
registrar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pvc-label-sync&#34;&gt;PVC Label Sync&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PVC Label Sync Controller applies labels that have been added to your PVCs
to your &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/docs/concepts/volumes/&#34;&gt;StorageOS Volume objects&lt;/a&gt;. The
PVC must have the StorageOS CSI Driver annotation. If there is a label with the
same key on the PVC and on the StorageClass the PVC label will take precedence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;StorageOS dynamically provisions StorageOS Volumes when you create a PVC
object. Labels are initially applied to your StorageOS Volume object when it is
created. These come from the labels specified in the PVC manifest as well as
any default labels specified in the StorageClass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This controller is triggered on any subsequent PVC label update event, so long
as the CSI Driver annotation is present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a label sync fails the change will be requeued and retried. A periodic
resync runs every hour (this is configurable via &lt;code&gt;-pvc-label-resync-interval&lt;/code&gt;
flag for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/storageos/api-manager&#34;&gt;API Manager&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;node-label-sync&#34;&gt;Node Label Sync&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Node Label Sync controller ensures that labels applied to your Kubernetes
nodes are synced through to StorageOS. It is necessary for your &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/docs/concepts/nodes/&#34;&gt;Node&lt;/a&gt; to have the StorageOS CSI Driver annotation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When labels are applied to your Kubernetes nodes, they do not automatically
sync to StorageOS, hence this controller is required to automatically apply the
expected behaviour to your StorageOS cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is triggered on any Kubernetes label update event, so long as the CSI Drive
annotation is present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a label sync fails the change will be requeued and retried. A periodic
resync runs every hour (this is configurable via &lt;code&gt;-node-label-resync-interval&lt;/code&gt;
flag for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/storageos/api-manager&#34;&gt;API Manager&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;node-delete&#34;&gt;Node Delete&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Node Delete Controller syncs deletions from your Kubernetes cluster to
StorageOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This controller dynamically removes nodes from your StorageOS cluster, being
triggered when the Kubernetes node is removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever a node delete event occurs the Node Delete Controller will trigger if
the node has the StorageOS CSI driver annotation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the node holds a StorageOS Volume without a replica then it cannot be
deleted by this controller. The Volume must be deleted first and then the node.
This is to prevent data loss by accidental deletion of a master volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A periodic garbage collection runs every hour (this is configurable via
&lt;code&gt;-node-delete-gc-interval&lt;/code&gt; flag for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/storageos/api-manager&#34;&gt;API
Manager&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;namespace-delete&#34;&gt;Namespace Delete&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Namespace Delete Controller is responsible for removing StorageOS
&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/docs/concepts/namespaces/&#34;&gt;namespaces&lt;/a&gt; from the StorageOS
cluster when the corresponding Kubernetes namespace has been removed from
Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The StorageOS controlplane automatically creates a new StorageOS namespace when
a PVC is created in a Kubernetes namespace. StorageOS does not automatically
remove namespaces when there are no volumes in them. Instead this controller
triggers on any Kubernetes namespace deletion event, syncing Kubernetes
namespace deletion to StorageOS namespace deletion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A periodic garbage collection runs every hour (this is configurable via
&lt;code&gt;-namespace-delete-gc-interval&lt;/code&gt; flag for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/storageos/api-manager&#34;&gt;API
Manager&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Docs: StorageOS Feature Labels</title>
      <link>https://docs.storageos.com/docs/reference/labels/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://docs.storageos.com/docs/reference/labels/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;Feature labels are a powerful and flexible way to control storage features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applying specific feature labels triggers compression, replication and other
storage features. No feature labels are present by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;storageos-node-labels&#34;&gt;StorageOS Node labels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nodes do not have any feature labels present by default.  When StorageOS is run
within Kubernetes, the StorageOS API Manager syncs any Kubernetes node labels
to the corresponding StorageOS node. The Kubernetes node labels act as the
&amp;ldquo;source of truth&amp;rdquo;, so labels should be applied to the Kubernetes nodes rather
than to StorageOS nodes. This is because the Kubernetes node labels overwrite
the StorageOS node labels on sync.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Feature&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Label&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Values&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Compute only&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;storageos.com/computeonly&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;true / false&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Specifies whether a node should be &lt;code&gt;computeonly&lt;/code&gt; where it only acts as a client and does not host volume data locally, otherwise the node is hyperconverged (the default), where the node can operate in both client and server modes.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can set the computeonly label on the Kubernetes node and the label will be
sync&amp;rsquo;d to the StorageOS node (labels take an eventual consistency
reconciliation time of ~1min).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;kubectl label node &lt;span style=&#34;color:#000&#34;&gt;$NODE&lt;/span&gt; storageos.com/computeonly&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ce5c00;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#204a87&#34;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;storageos-volume-labels&#34;&gt;StorageOS Volume labels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volumes do not have any feature labels present by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WARNING: The encryption, caching and compression labels can only apply
at provisioning time, they can&amp;rsquo;t be changed during execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Feature&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Label&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Values&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Caching&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;storageos.com/nocache&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;true / false&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Switches off caching.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Compression&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;storageos.com/nocompress&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;true / false&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Switches off compression of data at rest and in transit (compression is not enabled by default to maximise performance).&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Encryption&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;storageos.com/encryption&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;true / false&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Encrypts the contents of the volume. For each volume, a key is automatically generated, stored, and linked with the PVC.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Failure Mode&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;storageos.com/failure-mode&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;hard, soft, alwayson or integers [0, 5]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Sets the failure mode for a volume, either explicitly using a failure mode or implicitly using a replica threshold.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Replication&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;storageos.com/replicas&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;integers [0, 5]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Sets the number of replicas i.e full copies of the data across nodes. Typically 1 or 2 replicas is sufficient (2 or 3 instances of the data); latency implications need to be assesed when using more than 2 replicas.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create a volume with a feature label:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Option 1: PVC Label&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add the label in the PVC definition, for instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34; data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#204a87;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;apiVersion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;v1&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#204a87;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;kind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;PersistentVolumeClaim&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#204a87;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;metadata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#204a87;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;pvc&lt;span style=&#34;color:#0000cf;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;-3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#204a87;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;labels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#204a87;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;storageos.com/replicas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;1&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8f5902;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;# Label &amp;lt;-----&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#204a87;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;spec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#204a87;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;storageClassName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;fast&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#204a87;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;accessModes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;- ReadWriteOnce&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#204a87;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;resources&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#204a87;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;requests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#204a87;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;storage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;1G&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Option 2: Set label in the StorageClass&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any PVC using the StorageClass inherits the label. The PVC label takes
precedence over the StorageClass parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34; data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#204a87;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;apiVersion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;storage.k8s.io/v1&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#204a87;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;kind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;StorageClass&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#204a87;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;metadata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#204a87;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;storageos-replicated&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#204a87;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;csi.storage.k8s.io/fstype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;ext4&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#204a87;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;storageos.com/replicas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;1&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8f5902;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;# Label   &amp;lt;--------&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N.B. The StorageOS API manager periodically syncs labels from Kubernetes PVCs
to the corresponding StorageOS volume. Therefore changes to StorageOS volume
labels should be made to the corresponding Kubernetes PVC rather than to the
StorageOS volume directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;storageos-pod-labels&#34;&gt;StorageOS Pod labels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Feature&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Label&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Values&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Pod fencing&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;storageos.com/fenced&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;true / false&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Targets a pod to be fenced in case of node failure. (default: false)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a pod to be fenced by StorageOS, a few requirements described in the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/docs/operations/fencing/&#34;&gt;Fencing Operations&lt;/a&gt; page need to be fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;kubectl label pod &lt;span style=&#34;color:#000&#34;&gt;$POD&lt;/span&gt; storageos.com/fenced&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ce5c00;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#204a87&#34;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is recommended to define the fenced label in the pod&amp;rsquo;s manifest, i.e in the
Statefulset definitions. Statefulsets pass labels to their
VolumeClaimTemplates. You must set the label only at the
&lt;code&gt;spec.template.metadata.labels&lt;/code&gt;. Otherwise, the StorageOS volumes will fail to
provision as only special accepted labels can be passed to volumes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;apiVersion: apps/v1

      <link>https://docs.storageos.com/docs/reference/licence/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;A newly installed StorageOS cluster does not include a licence. A cluster can
run unlicensed for 24 hours. After that, new operations such as volume
provisioning or adding nodes are not permitted. Normal functioning of the
cluster can be unlocked by applying a Free Developer licence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn how to apply a licence to your cluster, check the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/docs/operations/licensing/&#34;&gt;operations
licensing&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;free-developer-licence&#34;&gt;Free Developer licence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The developer licence only requires the user to register and issue a
licence through StorageOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The developer licence is free and grants a licence for a 5 node StorageOS
cluster with 5TB of provisioned capacity. It is designed to enable basic cloud
native workflows in Kubernetes that require the persistence of stateful
application data. Dynamic provisioning, distributed access to data and high
availability of volumes through synchronous replication and automatic failover
are some of the features that are available under the developer licence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The free developer licence includes community support through &lt;a href=&#34;https://slack.storageos.com&#34;&gt;our public Slack
channel.&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;commercial-licences&#34;&gt;Commercial licences&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For information on our commercial offerings, including support, please contact
&lt;a href=&#34;mailto:sales@storageos.com&#34;&gt;sales@storageos.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;note-about-capacity-limits&#34;&gt;Note about capacity limits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some StorageOS licences have limits on capacity. StorageOS allows provisioning
volumes until the limit of the licence is reached. Only the size of the volume
requested by the Persistent Volume Claim counts for the licence limit,
regardless whether of whether the volume has replication enabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the licence limit is reached, new volumes are not able to provision unless
provisioned capacity is released, i.e deleting volumes. That behaviour is not
tight to the capacity of the backend disks on your nodes.&lt;/p&gt;

   and conversions to other media types.

   &amp;quot;Work&amp;quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
   Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
   copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
   (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

   &amp;quot;Derivative Works&amp;quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
   form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
   editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
   represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
   of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
   separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,

   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the

   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work

   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
   as of the date such litigation is filed.

   meet the following conditions:

   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or

       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
       the Derivative Works; and

   (d) If the Work includes a &amp;quot;NOTICE&amp;quot; text file as part of its
       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
       as modifying the License.

   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
   the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of

   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &amp;quot;AS IS&amp;quot; BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      &amp;quot;Contribution&amp;quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &amp;quot;submitted&amp;quot;
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as &amp;quot;Not a Contribution.&amp;quot;

      &amp;quot;Contributor&amp;quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a &amp;quot;NOTICE&amp;quot; text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &amp;quot;AS IS&amp;quot; BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      &amp;quot;Derivative Works&amp;quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      &amp;quot;Contribution&amp;quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including

      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a &amp;quot;NOTICE&amp;quot; text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &amp;quot;AS IS&amp;quot; BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason

        Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
        modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
        Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as

     effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes
     such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

     The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this
     License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution
     or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section
     2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:

     a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or

     b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s
        modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
        Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
        Version); or

     c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its
        Contributions.

     This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or
     logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the
     notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

     No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
     distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License
     (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted
     under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

     Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions
     are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the
     rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

     This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable
     copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

     Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in
     Section 2.1.


3. Responsibilities

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

     All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
     Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the
     terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form
     of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how
     they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or
     restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
        of distribution to the recipient; and

     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,
        or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for
        the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’
        rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the
     Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software
     with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered
     Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits
     You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of
     such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at
     their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of
     either this License or such Secondary License(s).

3.4. Notices

     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including
     copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
     of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered
     Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent
     required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf
     of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
     warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You
     alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
     jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial
   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
   they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
   distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the
   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
   understand it.

5. Termination

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,
     if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.
     Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an
     ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by
     some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of
     non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become
     compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,
     and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or
     indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and
     all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License
     shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
     termination shall survive termination.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty

   Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without
   warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
   without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
   merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire
   risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.
   Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any
   Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or
   correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this
   License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License
   except under this disclaimer.

7. Limitation of Liability

   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
   party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
   Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

8. Litigation

   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of
   a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business
   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
   prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
   contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe
   this License against a Contributor.


10. Versions of the License

10.1. New Versions

      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
      10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or

      steward.

10.3. Modified Versions

      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
      create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified
      version of this License if you rename the license and remove any
      references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such
      modified license differs from this License).

   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
   understand it.

5. Termination

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,
     if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.
     Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an
     ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by
     some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of
     non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become
     compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,
     and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or
     indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and
     all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License
     shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user

6. Disclaimer of Warranty

   Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without
   warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
   without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
   merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire
   risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.
   Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any
   Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or
   correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this
   License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License
   except under this disclaimer.

   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
   party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
   Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

8. Litigation

   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of
   a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business
   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
   prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
   contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe
   this License against a Contributor.

        Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,

     distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
     Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
     Contributor:

     the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

     License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
     permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

     Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to
     grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

3. Responsibilities

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

     All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
     Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
     the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
     Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
     License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
     attempt to alter or restrict the recipients&#39; rights in the Source Code
     Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
        of distribution to the recipient; and

     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
        License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
        license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the
        recipients&#39; rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
     the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
     Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
     Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
     License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
     under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
     the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
     Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
     License(s).

3.4. Notices

     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
     (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or
     limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the
     Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the
     extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
     behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
     such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
     You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
     jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute,
   judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of
   this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
   limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a
   text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under
   this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation,
   such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary
   skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing
     basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by
     some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into
     compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are
     reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the
     non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have
     received notice of non-compliance with this License from such
     Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt
     of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
     counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
     directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
     You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
     2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
     termination shall survive termination.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty

   Covered Software is provided under this License on an &amp;quot;as is&amp;quot; basis,
   without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory,
   including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free
   of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing.
   The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software
   is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect,
   You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,
   repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential
   part of this License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under
   this License except under this disclaimer.

7. Limitation of Liability

   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from
   such party&#39;s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such
   limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
   incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may
   not apply to You.

8. Litigation

   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts
   of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of
   business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
   jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing
   in this Section shall prevent a party&#39;s ability to bring cross-claims or
   counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
   matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
   unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
   necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that
   the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not
   be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

     Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits
     You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of
     such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at
     their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of
     either this License or such Secondary License(s).

3.4. Notices

     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including
     copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
     of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered
     Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent
     required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf
     of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
     warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You
     alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
     jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial
   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
   they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
   distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the
   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
   understand it.

5. Termination

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,
     if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.
     Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an
     ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by
     some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of
     non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become
     compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,
     and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or
     indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and
     all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License
     shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
     termination shall survive termination.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty

   Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without
   warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
   without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
   merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire
   risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.
   Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any
   Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or
   correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this
   License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License
   except under this disclaimer.

7. Limitation of Liability

   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
   party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
   Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

8. Litigation

   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of
   a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business
   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
   prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
   contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe
   this License against a Contributor.

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

     All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
     Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the
     terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form
     of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how
     they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or
     restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
        of distribution to the recipient; and

     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,
        or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for
        the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’
        rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the
     Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software
     with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered
     Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits
     You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of
     such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at
     their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of
     either this License or such Secondary License(s).

3.4. Notices

     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including
     copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
     of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered
     Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent
     required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf
     of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
     warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You
     alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
     jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial
   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
   they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
   distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the
   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
   understand it.

5. Termination

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,
     if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.
     Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an
     ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by
     some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of
     non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become
     compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,
     and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or
     indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and
     all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License
     shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
     termination shall survive termination.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty

   Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without
   warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
   without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
   merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire
   risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.
   Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any
   Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or
   correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this
   License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License
   except under this disclaimer.

7. Limitation of Liability

   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
   party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
   Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

8. Litigation

   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of
   a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business
   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
   prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
   contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe
   this License against a Contributor.

     notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

     No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
     distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License
     (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted
     under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

     Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions
     are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the
     rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

     This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable
     copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

     Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in
     Section 2.1.


3. Responsibilities

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

     All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
     Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the
     terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form
     of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how
     they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or
     restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
        of distribution to the recipient; and

     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,
        or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for
        the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’
        rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the
     Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software
     with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered
     Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits
     You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of
     such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at
     their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of
     either this License or such Secondary License(s).

3.4. Notices

     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including
     copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
     of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered
     Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent
     required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf
     of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
     warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You
     alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
     jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial
   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
   they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
   distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the
   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
   understand it.

5. Termination

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,
     if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.
     Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an
     ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by
     some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of
     non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become
     compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,
     and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or
     indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and
     all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License
     shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
     termination shall survive termination.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty

   Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without
   warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
   without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
   merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire
   risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.
   Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any
   Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or
   correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this
   License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License
   except under this disclaimer.

7. Limitation of Liability

   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
   party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
   Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

8. Litigation

   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of
   a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business
   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
   prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
   contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe
   this License against a Contributor.


10. Versions of the License

10.1. New Versions

      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
      10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or

      steward.

10.3. Modified Versions

3. Responsibilities

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

     All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
     Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the
     terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form
     of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how
     they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or
     restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
        of distribution to the recipient; and

     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,
        or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for
        the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’
        rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the
     Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software
     with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered
     Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits
     You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of
     such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at
     their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of
     either this License or such Secondary License(s).

3.4. Notices

     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including
     copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
     of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered
     Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent
     required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf
     of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
     warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You
     alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
     jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial
   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
   they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
   distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the
   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
   understand it.

5. Termination

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,
     if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.
     Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an
     ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by
     some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of
     non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become
     compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,
     and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or
     indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and
     all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License
     shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
     termination shall survive termination.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty

   Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without
   warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
   without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
   merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire
   risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.
   Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any
   Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or
   correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this
   License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License
   except under this disclaimer.

7. Limitation of Liability

   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
   party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
   Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

8. Litigation

   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of
   a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business
   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
   prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
   contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe
   this License against a Contributor.

2. License Grants and Conditions

2.1. Grants

     Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
     non-exclusive license:

     a. under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
        Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
        modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
        Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as
        part of a Larger Work; and

     b. under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for
        sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions
        or its Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date

     The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become
     effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes
     such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

     The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this
     License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution
     or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section
     2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:

     a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or

     b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s
        modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
        Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
        Version); or

     c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its
        Contributions.

     This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or
     logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the
     notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

     No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
     distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License
     (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted
     under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

     Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions
     are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the
     rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

     This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable
     copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

     Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in
     Section 2.1.


3. Responsibilities

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

     All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
     Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the
     terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form
     of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how
     they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or
     restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
        of distribution to the recipient; and

     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,
        or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for
        the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’
        rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the
     Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software
     with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered
     Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits
     You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of
     such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at
     their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of
     either this License or such Secondary License(s).

3.4. Notices

     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including
     copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
     of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered
     Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent
     required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf
     of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
     warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You
     alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
     jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial
   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
   they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
   distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the
   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
   understand it.

5. Termination

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,
     if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.
     Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an
     ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by
     some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of
     non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become
     compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,
     and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or
     indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and
     all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License
     shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
     termination shall survive termination.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty

   Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without
   warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
   without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
   merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire
   risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.
   Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any
   Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or
   correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this
   License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License
   except under this disclaimer.

7. Limitation of Liability

   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
   party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
   Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

8. Litigation

   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of
   a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business
   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
   prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
   contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe
   this License against a Contributor.


10. Versions of the License

10.1. New Versions

      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
      10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
      publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
      distinguishing version number.

10.2. Effect of New Versions

      You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of
      the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or
      under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
      steward.

10.3. Modified Versions

      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
      create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified
      version of this License if you rename the license and remove any
      references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such
      modified license differs from this License).

10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses
      If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
      Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
      notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.

Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice

      This Source Code Form is subject to the
      terms of the Mozilla Public License, v.
      2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not
      distributed with this file, You can
      obtain one at
      http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.

If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then
You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant
directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.

You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

Exhibit B - “Incompatible With Secondary Licenses” Notice

      This Source Code Form is “Incompatible
      With Secondary Licenses”, as defined by
      the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;We recommend always using &amp;ldquo;tagged&amp;rdquo; versions of StorageOS rather than &amp;ldquo;latest&amp;rdquo;,
and to perform upgrades only after reading the release notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest tagged release is &lt;code&gt;v2.4.2&lt;/code&gt;. For
installation instructions please see our
&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/docs/reference/cluster-operator/install/&#34;&gt;Install&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest CLI release is &lt;code&gt;v2.4.2&lt;/code&gt;, available from
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/storageos/go-cli/releases&#34;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;improved-1&#34;&gt;Improved&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dataplane: Reduce replication thread usage by having the replication processes
share the main thread pool.  This helps ensure that there isn&amp;rsquo;t a spike in
thread usage when a node recovers and begins re-syncing its volumes.  This is
particularly relevant on CRIO-based orchestrators such as Openshift where the
default maximum allowed PID limit (which also governs the thread limit) is
low.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dataplane: Detect and log the effective maximum PID limit on startup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dataplane: Internal device presentation mappings are now ephemeral and are not
persisted across reboots.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dataplane: Disabled default verbose logging for fdatasync/flushWAL timers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dataplane: Log both volume inode and UUID in replication error messages for
easier correlation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dataplane: On startup, ensure any remnant devices that may have been left
after an unclean shutdown have been properly cleared.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dataplane: Signal when all startup tasks complete.  This ensures no IO can be
initiated before this time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ha: Implement a backoff when attempting to repoint an attached volume after
the master has failed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ha: Replicas can now rejoin after an asymmetric partition. This can occur when
the master has not lost communication to the replica, but the replica can&amp;rsquo;t
communicate with the master.  Previously the replica would not be able to
rejoin until the master determined it had failed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ha: A master that was partitioned can now re-join to the new master as a
replica.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;api: node label changes update target node prior to committing new state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;api: Validation errors now include more information on the failure and how to
resolve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;csi: Volume resize error messages (e.g. capacity exceeded) now passed through
in CSI response.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;csi: Volume attachment is now verified prior to mount for more instructive
error message.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;csi: Returns &lt;code&gt;RESOURCE EXHAUSTED&lt;/code&gt; error when attempting to exceed maximum of
250 StorageOS volume attachments per node.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;diagnostics: Multiple improvements to bundle collection and collected data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ui: Allow collection of partial diagnostics bundles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ui: Tolerate clock skew when authenticating via the UI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;licensing: Read-through cache added.  Licence updates will take up to 60s to
propagate to all nodes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cli: Set replicas output formatting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;init: Checks the effective maximum PID limit and warns if less than the
StorageOS recommended PID limit (32,768).  CRIO-based distributions such as
Openshift have a much lower default value (1024).  Consult
&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/docs/prerequisites/pidlimits/&#34;&gt;prerequisites&lt;/a&gt; for more
information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fixed-6&#34;&gt;Fixed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dataplane: Fixes &lt;code&gt;transport endpoint is not connected&lt;/code&gt; on startup after an
unclean shutdown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;csi: Volume unmount requests now succeed when the mountpoint has
already been removed by the orchestrator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;csi: Volume detach requests now succeed when the volume has already been
deleted.  Previously the volume would be stuck in &lt;code&gt;Terminating&lt;/code&gt; status.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;v220---released-2020-08-18&#34;&gt;v2.2.0 - Released 2020-08-18&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release focuses on performance. We analysed existing performance
characteristics across a variety of real-world use cases and ended up with
improvements across the board. Of particular note:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sequential reads have improved by up to 130%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sequential writes have improved by up to 737%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Random reads have improved by up to 45%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Random writes have improved by up to 135%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I/O for large block sizes (128K) has improved by up to 353%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are extremely proud of our performance and we love to talk about it. Have a
look at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/docs/self-eval/#Benchmarking&#34;&gt;Benchmarking&lt;/a&gt; section of the self-evaluation guide and consider sharing
your results. Our PRE engineers are available to discuss in our &lt;a href=&#34;https://storageos.slack.com&#34;&gt;slack
channel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;new-4&#34;&gt;New&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data engine revamp focused on provable consistency and performance. Key
characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Metadata is stored in an optimised index, lowering I/O latency and improving
performance for all workloads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Large block reads/writes are now be handled in a single operation.
Applications like Kafka will go much faster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On-disk compression is now disabled by default as in most scenarios this
offers better performance. To enable on-disk compression for a specific
workload, see &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/docs/concepts/compression/&#34;&gt;compression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;improved-2&#34;&gt;Improved&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dataplane: The number of I/O threads are now determined by the number of
processing cores available.  This improves scalability and performance on
larger servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ha: Improve partition tolerance behaviour when a volume master that has lost
its connection to etcd rejoins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ha: Allow replicas in unhealthy states to be remediated and re-used while
maintaining partition tolerance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ha: When a master fails and the new master is not yet available, introduce a
back-off to the redirection logic to avoid spamming the logs with connection
failure errors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ha: Ignore health advertisements for local node. Local nodes are handled
directly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;node delete: Only refuse to delete a node if the node health can be
authoritatively verified to be in use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;api: Increase HTTP server write timeout.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cli/ui: Allow partial diagnostic bundle downloads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ui: Namespace dropdown can now be scrolled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ui: Add &amp;ldquo;Job title&amp;rdquo; to UI licence form.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;logging: Log version at startup at INFO level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;logging: Lower verbosity of SCSI warnings that do not apply to StorageOS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;diagnostics: Include logs that have been rotated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;diagnostics: Bundle collection across providers is now done in parallel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;build: Update base image to RHEL 8.2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;operator: Removed DB migration utility required for v1.3 -&amp;gt; v1.4 upgrades.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;operator: Automatically refreshes StorageOS API token without failing
requests when the token expires.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;operator: Updated CSI attacher and provisioner to latest upstream.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;operator: Remove &lt;code&gt;cluster.local&lt;/code&gt; suffix on Pod scheduler service address.
This allows the scheduler to work in clusters with custom DNS configuration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;operator: Defaults are now set for most CSI configuration options in the
StorageOSCluster custom resource.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fixed-7&#34;&gt;Fixed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;csi: When unmount request is received for a volume that has already been
unmounted, return success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;csi: Verify volume is attached on the node before mounting it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;xfs: Support older RHEL kernels which have an XFS library that does not
allow reflinks/dedupe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dataplane: Reserve 1GiB of capacity on the target disk to allow manual cleanup
operations, rather than filling target disk to capacity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;operator: In some cases &lt;code&gt;/var/lib/storageos&lt;/code&gt; could fail to unmount cleanly
after a restart. This resulted in multiple entries in &lt;code&gt;/proc/mounts&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;v210---released-2020-06-26&#34;&gt;v2.1.0 - Released 2020-06-26&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;new-5&#34;&gt;New&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;csi: Volume expansion now supported in offline mode. To expand a volume, stop
any workloads accessing the volume, then edit the PVC to increase the
capacity. For more information, see our &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/docs/operations/resize/&#34;&gt;Volume Resize&lt;/a&gt; operations page and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/volume-expansion.html&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;CSI Volume Expansion&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;api: Volume configuration including replica count can now be updated while
the volume is in use. Other updateable fields include labels and
description.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;failover: Before determining that a node is offline and performing recovery
operations, the I/O path is also verified. This provides more robust failure
detection and ensures that nodes that are still responding to I/O do not get
replaced. This I/O path verification is in addition to the gossip-based
failure detection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;operator: Default tolerations are now set for the StorageOS node container.
This helps ensure that the StorageOS node container does not get evicted when
the node is running low on resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;improved-3&#34;&gt;Improved&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;api: Added checks to prevent deletion of a node with active volumes, or if it
is the master of at least one volume. This helps prevent orphaned volumes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cli: Add an &lt;code&gt;--offline-delete&lt;/code&gt; flag to allow removal of volumes whose master
and replica nodes are offline. This allows cleanup of orphaned volumes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ui: Add an offline volume delete option.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ui: Volumes can now be detached from the UI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cli: Labels are no longer truncated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;api: When a new node is added to the cluster, its capacity is available to use
immediately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fixed-8&#34;&gt;Fixed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ui: Favicon was missing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ui: Duplicate volumes could be shown on the node details page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;operator: During uninstall a ClusterRoleBinding was not removed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;v200---released-2020-05-05&#34;&gt;v2.0.0 - Released 2020-05-05&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;new-6&#34;&gt;New&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;operator: StorageOS containers now run in the &lt;code&gt;kube-system&lt;/code&gt; namespace by
default to allow the &lt;code&gt;system-node-critical&lt;/code&gt; priority class to be set. This
instructs Kubernetes to start StorageOS before application Pods, and to evict
StorageOS only after application Pods have finished. This setting was
previously recommended in documentation; it is now the default.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;operator: StorageOS CSI helper containers now run as privileged. This ensures
that the CSI endpoint can be seen on systems with SELinux enabled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ui: replication progress for new or re-joining replicas is now displayed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ui: show warning for unlicensed clusters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cli: new commands:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;licence management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;get policy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create namespace&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create policy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;describe user&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;describe namespace&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;describe policy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;delete user&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;delete namespace&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;delete policy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;licence: removed the default licence expiry date added for &lt;code&gt;v2.0.0-rc.1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;improved-4&#34;&gt;Improved&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dataplane: improved retry behaviour for network I/O.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cli: &amp;ldquo;get volumes&amp;rdquo; for all namespaces should be done in parallel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cli: help text document config file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ui: link node name and get to node details on the volume details page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ui: node details add available capacity spinner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ui: node list remove capacity values / address port.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ui: node list show master/replica counts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ui: node list remove edit action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ui: format entity labels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ui: node details link volumes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ui: align buttons for licences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ui: k8s warning in &amp;ldquo;create volume&amp;rdquo; modal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ui: node list remove &amp;ldquo;API&amp;rdquo; from &amp;ldquo;API Address&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ui: add some details about the Licence on the licence page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;api: include valid for duration in login response.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;licence: restrict nodes which are unregistered after 24 hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;scheduler: return error for namespace/volume not found&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dataplane: start gRPC threads separately from rest of the supervisor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fixed-9&#34;&gt;Fixed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ui: centre licence types.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ui: capacity in ui is per namespace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cli: fail gracefully if missing some output details (i.e. no node exists for id).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;v200-rc1---released-2020-03-31&#34;&gt;v2.0.0-rc.1 - Released 2020-03-31&lt;/h2&gt;

      <title>Docs: Resource Requests and Limits</title>
      <link>https://docs.storageos.com/docs/reference/resource_requests_and_limits/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://docs.storageos.com/docs/reference/resource_requests_and_limits/</guid>

        &lt;h2 id=&#34;managing-resources-for-storageos-containers&#34;&gt;Managing Resources for StorageOS containers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes resource requests and limits are two optional Pod properties that
allow you to specify how much of a resource a container in a Pod needs or can
use. They are two main resources that you can specify requests and limits for,
CPU and Memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As StorageOS is an infrastructure component, the health of other applications
depends on being able to write to the StorageOS volumes. As such it is of
paramount importance to avoid restarts of the StorageOS DaemonSet Pods.
Restarting a StorageOS Pod results in the volumes of the node the StorageOS Pod
is running on being marked as Read Only, and causes the failover of primary
volumes on that node to their replicas. After a StorageOS Pod restart, once the
StorageOS DaemonSet Pod is &amp;ldquo;READY&amp;rdquo;, the application Pods running on the node
need to be restarted in order to trigger a mount of the filesystem hosted on
the StorageOS volume and resume normal operations. To avoid restarts of the
StorageOS main container by Kubernetes due to resource limits being reached, it
is recommended to not set resource limits on the StorageOS DaemonSet. In
addition to avoiding resource limits, StorageOS uses a &lt;a href=&#34;https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/pod-priority-preemption/#priorityclass&#34;&gt;high priority
class&lt;/a&gt;
when the DaemonSet is installed in the &amp;lsquo;kube-system&amp;rsquo; namespace. That avoids the
DaemonSet Pods of being evicted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information about managing resources for containers please see the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/&#34;&gt;Kubernetes
documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Docs: StorageOS Scheduler</title>
      <link>https://docs.storageos.com/docs/reference/scheduler/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://docs.storageos.com/docs/reference/scheduler/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;StorageOS has the capacity to influence Kubernetes Pod placement decisions to
ensure that Pods are scheduled on the same nodes as their data. This
functionality is known as &lt;code&gt;Pod Locality&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;StorageOS grants access to data by presenting, on local or remote nodes, the
devices used in a Pod&amp;rsquo;s VolumeMounts. However, it is often the case that it is
required or preferred to place the Pod on the node where the StorageOS Primary
Volume is located, because IO operations are fastest as a result of minimized
network traffic and associated latency. Read operations are served locally and
writes require fewer round trips to the replicas of the volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;StorageOS automatically enables the use of a custom scheduler for any Pod
using StorageOS Volumes. Checkout the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/docs/reference/scheduler/admission-controller/&#34;&gt;Admission Controller reference&lt;/a&gt; for more
information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;storageos-kubernetes-scheduler&#34;&gt;Storageos Kubernetes Scheduler&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;StorageOS achieves Pod locality by implementing a Kubernetes scheduler
extender. The Kubernetes standard scheduler interacts with the StorageOS
scheduler when placement decisions need to be made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kubernetes standard scheduler selects a set of nodes for a placement
decision based on nodeSelectors, affinity rules, etc. This list of nodes is
sent to the StorageOS scheduler which sends back the target node where the Pod
shall be placed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The StorageOS scheduler logic is provided by a Pod in the Namespace where
StorageOS Pods are running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;scheduling-process&#34;&gt;Scheduling process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a Pod needs to be scheduled, the scheduler collects information
about all available nodes and the requirements of the Pod. The collected
data is then passed through the Filter phase, during which the scheduler predicates
are applied to the node data to decide if the given nodes are compatible
with the Pod requirements. The result of the filter consists of a list of nodes
that are compatible for the given Pod and a list of nodes that aren&amp;rsquo;t
compatible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list of compatible nodes is then passed to the Prioritize phase, in which
the nodes are scored based on attributes such as the state. The result of the
Prioritize phase is a list of nodes with their respective scores. The more
favorable nodes get higher scores than less favorable nodes. The list is then
used by the scheduler to decide the final node to schedule the Pod on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a node has been selected, the third phase, Bind, handles the binding
of the Pod to the Kubernetes apiserver. Once bound, the kubelet on the node
provisions the Pod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The StorageOS scheduler implement Filter and Prioritization phases and leaves
binding to the default Kubernetes scheduler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The StorageOS scheduler filters nodes ensuring that the remaining subset
fulfill the following prerequisites:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The node is running StorageOS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The node is healthy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Docs: StorageOS Telemetry</title>
      <link>https://docs.storageos.com/docs/reference/telemetry/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://docs.storageos.com/docs/reference/telemetry/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;StorageOS collects telemetry and error reports from StorageOS clusters via two
different methods for two different purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;telemetry&#34;&gt;Telemetry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Telemetry is made up a DNS version check query and a once per day report.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Error reporting is the sentry.io crash dump reporting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sentryio&#34;&gt;sentry.io&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;StorageOS sends crash reports to &lt;a href=&#34;https://sentry.io&#34;&gt;sentry.io&lt;/a&gt;. This
information helps our developers monitor and fix crashes. Information is sent
to sentry.io when a process inside the StorageOS container
crashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The crash report contains the signal that triggered the shutdown (e.g. SIGSEGV),
the exit code and whether or not the crash generated a core dump.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All StorageOS clusters with a routable connection to the internet will send crash
reports to sentry.io over tcp/443. StorageOS respects environment variables that
&lt;a href=&#34;https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#ProxyFromEnvironment&#34;&gt;ProxyFromEnvironment&lt;/a&gt;
uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An exhaustive list of information included in the crash report is below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;StorageOS version&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crash description string&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anonymized Cluster ID&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anonymized Node ID&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dns-query&#34;&gt;DNS Query&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;StorageOS will perform a &amp;ldquo;latest version check&amp;rdquo; using a DNS query in order to
inform administrators that a new version is available. StorageOS will also send
anonymized node ids, cluster id and StorageOS version information to StorageOS
using a DNS query. The information that we send in the query is encoded as well
as being anonymized. This query allows us to inform Cluster admins when
StorageOS upgrades are available in the StorageOS GUI and in the logs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DNS query includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anonymized StorageOS Cluster ID&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anonymized StorageOS node ID&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;StorageOS version number&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;once-per-day-report&#34;&gt;Once Per Day Report&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The once per day report contains information about the StorageOS cluster and
Kubernetes versions to help StorageOS focus our development efforts on the most
popular platforms. The once per day data is encrypted and sent to a StorageOS
telemetry server so it is never processed outside of StorageOS assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An exhaustive list of information included in the once per day report is below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;api_call_metrics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cluster_disable_crash_reporting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cluster_disable_version_check&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cluster_log_format&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cluster_log_level&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cluster_tls_provided&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;k8s_distribution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;k8s_in_k8s&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;k8s_scheduler_extender_enabled&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;k8s_version&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;node_capacity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;node_crash_files_on_disk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;node_created_at_time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;node_etcd_config&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;node_etcd_namespacing_enabled&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;node_etcd_tls_enabled&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;node_free_bytes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;node_health&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;node_http_tls_enabled&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;node_id&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;node_labels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;node_status&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;node_storageos_version&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;node_system_clock_time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;node_total_bytes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;node_version&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volume_fs_type&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volume_id&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volume_labels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volume_master_attach&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volume_master_delete_deployment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volume_master_detach&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volume_master_failover_deployment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volume_master_promote&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volume_master_provision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volume_master_recover_replica&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volume_master_trigger_rejoin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volume_metrics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volume_placement_strategy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volume_provision_source_user_agent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volume_replica_delete_deployment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volume_replica_failover_deployment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volume_replica_promote&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volume_replica_provision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volume_replicas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volume_replica_trigger_rejoin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volume_size_bytes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;disable-telemetry&#34;&gt;Disable Telemetry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible to disable telemetry using the GUI, CLI, API, environment
variables or the StorageOS Cluster Spec.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;storageos-cluster-spec&#34;&gt;StorageOS Cluster Spec&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disable telemetry explicitly through the configurable &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/docs/reference/cluster-operator/configuration/&#34;&gt;spec parameters&lt;/a&gt; of the
StorageOSCluster custom resource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;environment-variables&#34;&gt;Environment Variables&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use the following environmental variables to disable or enable telemetry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;DISABLE_VERSION_CHECK   &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8f5902;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;# Disable the DNS version check&lt;/span&gt;
DISABLE_TELEMETRY       &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8f5902;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;# Disable the once per day reporting&lt;/span&gt;
DISABLE_ERROR_REPORTING &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8f5902;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;# Disable sentry.io crash reports&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;h2 id=&#34;host-filesystems&#34;&gt;Host Filesystems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;StorageOS will automatically use &lt;code&gt;/var/lib/storageos&lt;/code&gt; on each host as a base
directory for storing &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/docs/concepts/volumes#blob-files&#34;&gt;configuration and blob
files&lt;/a&gt;. Supported host filesystem types
are &lt;code&gt;ext4&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;xfs&lt;/code&gt;. If you require a specific filesystem please &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/docs/support/contactus&#34;&gt;contact
StorageOS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;persistent-volume-filesystems&#34;&gt;Persistent Volume Filesystems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;StorageOS provides a block device on which a file system can be created. The
creation of the filesystem is either handled by StorageOS or by Kubernetes
which affects what filesystems can be created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;csi-driver&#34;&gt;CSI Driver&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When using StorageOS with the CSI driver, StorageOS is responsible for running
mkfs against the block device that pods mount. StorageOS is able to create
ext2, ext3, ext4 and xfs file systems.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Docs: Tolerations</title>
      <link>https://docs.storageos.com/docs/reference/tolerations/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;h2 id=&#34;kubernetes-tolerations&#34;&gt;Kubernetes Tolerations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tolerations are a Kubernetes pod property that allow pods to tolerate certain
node taints. Taints can be thought of as the opposite of Node affinity in that
taints repel pods. Node taints are automatically applied by Kubernetes in
response to node resources coming under contention. As StorageOS provides
storage to pods it should not be evicted during periods of resource contention,
as any pods using StorageOS volumes on the same node would need to be
restarted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As StorageOS runs as a daemonset some Kubernetes tolerations are added by
Kubernetes while others are automatically added by the StorageOS operator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information about tolerations please see the &lt;a href=&#34;https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/&#34;&gt;Kubernetes
documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
