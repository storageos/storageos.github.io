  description: |
    The StorageOS API is an HTTP API used for managing volumes and StorageOS services. It is the API that the StorageOS UI, CLI and platform integrations use to communicate with the StorageOS backend.
    The REST APIs are accessible at port 5705 on any of the nodes in a StorageOS cluster.

    # Errors

    The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of the API call. The body of the response will be JSON in the following format:
    ```
    {
      "message": "page not found"
    }
    ```
# The tags on paths define the menu sections in the ReDoc documentation, so
# the usage of tags must make sense for that:
# - They should be singular, not plural.
# - There should not be too many tags, or the menu becomes unwieldy. For
#   example, it is preferable to add a path to the "System" tag instead of
#   creating a tag with a single path in it.
# - The order of tags in this list defines the order in the menu.

      Pools are used to define distributed capacity that can be used to provision
      volumes from.  Typically, each server that makes storage available will be
      added to one or more pools.

      Capacity drivers are also added to the pool to determine which backend
      storage driver to use.  Currently this is limited to a single type of
      driver per pool, but in the future we will allow multiple, allowing for
      dynamic tiering and snapshots from one driver type to another.
