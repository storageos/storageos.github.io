        &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;storageos&lt;/code&gt; command line interface (CLI) is used to manage cluster-wide
configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

templates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;StorageOS CLI v1.2.0 added help for the &lt;code&gt;--format&lt;/code&gt; option. The help can be
accessed by passing &lt;code&gt;--format help&lt;/code&gt; to StorageOS CLI commands to get context
specific help.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;On startup, you will need to specify whether a StorageOS node should bootstrap
a new cluster or join an existing cluster. In order for a bootstrapping node to
join or create a cluster, the node needs to know where to find the other nodes
in the cluster. The node is informed of other nodes in the cluster via the JOIN
environment variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cluster-initialisation---using-storageos-operator&#34;&gt;Cluster Initialisation - Using StorageOS Operator&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For standard installs, the StorageOS operator will automatically populate the
JOIN variable with appropriate values. For users with advanced requirements,
the operator allows specification of a custom JOIN variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cluster-initialisation---advancedcustom-installations&#34;&gt;Cluster Initialisation - Advanced/Custom Installations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;StorageOS offers a public discovery service, which is a convenient way to
pass clustering information to the StorageOS node.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8f5902;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;# Create a cluster discovery token. This token is not used after initialization&lt;/span&gt;
$ storageos cluster create
017e4605-3c3a-434d-b4b1-dfe514a9cd0f

&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8f5902;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;# Add the returned cluster ID token to the JOIN variable&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#000&#34;&gt;JOIN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ce5c00;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;017e4605-3c3a-434d-b4b1-dfe514a9cd0f
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you can specify the IP addresses of nodes to join. If you
provide a list of node IPs any new node joining the cluster will attempt to
contact the node IPs specified. This means that if all the nodes in the JOIN
are unavailable that new nodes will be unable to join the cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8f5902;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;# Specify a node to connect to in an existing cluster&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#000&#34;&gt;JOIN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ce5c00;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;172.28.128.3

&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8f5902;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;# Specify a list of nodes to attempt to connect to, in left-to-right order&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#000&#34;&gt;JOIN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ce5c00;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;172.28.128.3,172.28.128.9,172.28.128.15

&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8f5902;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;# Specify both the discovery service and IP addresses, tried left-to-right&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#000&#34;&gt;JOIN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ce5c00;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;d53e9fae-7436-4185-82ea-c0446a52e2cd,172.28.128.3,172.28.128.9
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;JOIN&lt;/code&gt; command line argument is always required, even in clusters with only
one node. A blank &lt;code&gt;JOIN&lt;/code&gt; variable will result in a non-functional cluster. This
is to prevent non-obvious split-brain scenarios in multi-node clusters, where
&lt;code&gt;JOIN&lt;/code&gt; was mistakenly omitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8f5902;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;# Create a one-node cluster; note that replicas are unavailable.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#000&#34;&gt;JOIN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ce5c00;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#000&#34;&gt;$ADVERTISE_IP&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Docs: Cluster Operator</title>
      <link>https://docs.storageos.com/v1.x/docs/reference/cluster-operator/</link>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;Our cluster operator is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/extend-cluster/&#34;&gt;Kubernetes native
application&lt;/a&gt;
developed to deploy and configure StorageOS clusters, and assist with
maintenance operations. We recommend its use for standard installations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The operator acts as a Kubernetes controller that watches the &lt;code&gt;StorageOSCluster&lt;/code&gt;
CR (Custom Resource). Once the controller is ready, a StorageOS cluster definition can be
created. The operator will deploy a StorageOS cluster based on the
configuration specified in the cluster definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find the source code in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/storageos/cluster-operator&#34;&gt;cluster-operator
repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install the operator following orchestrator specific procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To deploy a StorageOS cluster you will need to fulfil the following steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install operator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create &lt;code&gt;storageos-api&lt;/code&gt; Secret&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a CR (Custom Resource) to deploy StorageOS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Several aspects of StorageOS behaviour can be controlled via environment
variables. These can be injected in via any of the usual mechanisms such as
&lt;a href=&#34;https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/&#34;&gt;ConfigMaps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;

&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;IP address of the node for incoming connections.  Defaults to first non-loopback address&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;API_PORT&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;1.0+&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;1.0+&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;To disable anonymous usage reporting across the cluster, set to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;. Defaults to &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;. To help improve the product, data such as API usage and StorageOS configuration information is collected&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;1.0+&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Toggles enhanced Kubernetes integration.  Defaults to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; and will be disabled automatically if Kubernetes API is not accessible.  Requires StorageOS to be deployed as a DaemonSet or Pod.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;JOIN&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;StorageOS provides a GUI for cluster and volume management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GUI is available at port 5705 on any of the nodes in the cluster. Initally
you can log in as the default administrator, using the username &lt;code&gt;storageos&lt;/code&gt; and
password &lt;code&gt;storageos&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/v1.x/images/docs/gui/login.png&#34; alt=&#34;Logging in&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;manage-cluster-nodes-and-pools&#34;&gt;Manage cluster nodes and pools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nodes and pools page allow you to manage cluster nodes and storage pool. In this example, this cluster consists of three nodes with 35.9GB capacity each. The default storage pool contains all three nodes, giving a total of 107.6GB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/v1.x/images/docs/gui/nodes.png&#34; alt=&#34;Managing nodes&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/v1.x/images/docs/gui/pools.png&#34; alt=&#34;Managing storage pools&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;create-and-view-volumes&#34;&gt;Create and view volumes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can create volumes, including replicated volumes, and view volume details:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Docs: Init container</title>
      <link>https://docs.storageos.com/v1.x/docs/reference/init-container/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://docs.storageos.com/v1.x/docs/reference/init-container/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;StorageOS has requirements for the configuration of host systems. As such,
StorageOS starts an init container that sets the system configuration for
StorageOS. The container also manages configuration changes required when
upgrading StorageOS versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The container belongs to the DaemonSet that the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/v1.x/docs/reference/cluster-operator/&#34;&gt;StorageOS Cluster
Operator&lt;/a&gt; starts when a
&lt;code&gt;StorageOSCluster&lt;/code&gt; resource is created. The &lt;code&gt;storageos-init&lt;/code&gt; container is
executed as an
&lt;a href=&#34;https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/&#34;&gt;initContainer&lt;/a&gt;
as part of a Kubernetes Pod. Therefore, only successful execution of the
&lt;code&gt;storageos-init&lt;/code&gt; container processes will result in the main container
starting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;script-framework&#34;&gt;Script Framework&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code responsible for fulfilling the requirements is based on a Script
Framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The script framework executes a set of scripts, performing checks,
verifications and other procedures needed for StorageOS to be able to start.
The scripts stdout and stderr are written to the stdout and stderr of the init
app. The container logs contain all the logs of the individual scripts that
run. The exit statuses of the scripts are used to determine initialization
failure or success. Any non-zero exit status is logged as an event in the
Kubernetes Pod events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If any of the scripts fail, the &lt;code&gt;storageos-init&lt;/code&gt; container will propagate the
failure to Kubernetes, showing the status of the Pod as &lt;code&gt;Init:Err&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To view the output of all &lt;code&gt;storageos-init&lt;/code&gt; containers the following command can
be used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;kubectl -n kube-system logs -l &lt;span style=&#34;color:#000&#34;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ce5c00;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;storageos,kind&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ce5c00;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;daemonset -c storageos-init
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more details, check the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/storageos/init&#34;&gt;StorageOS init container project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;scripts-executed&#34;&gt;Scripts executed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;storageos-init&lt;/code&gt; container executes the following scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/storageos/init/tree/master/scripts/01-lio&#34;&gt;enable-lio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/storageos/init/tree/master/scripts/10-dbupgrade-v1v2&#34;&gt;dbupgrade&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Docs: StorageOS Feature labels</title>
      <link>https://docs.storageos.com/v1.x/docs/reference/labels/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://docs.storageos.com/v1.x/docs/reference/labels/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;Feature labels are a powerful and flexible way to control storage features,
especially when combined with &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/v1.x/docs/reference/cli/rule/&#34;&gt;rules&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labels can be applied to various StorageOS artefacts. Applying specific feature
labels triggers compression, replication and other storage features. No feature
labels are present by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;storageos-node-labels&#34;&gt;StorageOS Node labels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nodes do not have any feature labels present by default.  When StorageOS is run
within Kubernetes with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/v1.x/docs/reference/cluster-operator/&#34;&gt;Cluster Operator&lt;/a&gt;, any node labels set on
Kubernetes nodes are available within StorageOS.  Node labels may also be set
with the CLI or UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Feature&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Label&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Values&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Deployment type&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;storageos.com/deployment&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;strings [&lt;code&gt;computeonly&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;mixed&lt;/code&gt;]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Specifies whether a node should be &lt;code&gt;computeonly&lt;/code&gt; where it only acts as a client and does not host volume data locally, or &lt;code&gt;mixed&lt;/code&gt; (the default), where the node can operate in both client and server modes.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Region&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;iaas/region&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;string&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Set automatically in AWS, Azure and GCE.  e.g. &lt;code&gt;eu-west-1&lt;/code&gt;.  Not currently used by StorageOS but available for use in rules.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Failure domain&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;iaas/failure-domain&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;string&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Used to spread master and replicas across different failure domains.  Set automatically in AWS, Azure and GCE, e.g. &lt;code&gt;eu-west-1b&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Update domain&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;iaas/update-domain&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;string&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Set by some cloud providers to perform sequential updates/reboots.  Not currently used by StorageOS but available for use in rules.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Size&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;iaas/size&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;string&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;The node hardware configuration, as set by the cloud provider, e.g. &lt;code&gt;m5d.xlarge&lt;/code&gt;.  Not currently used by StorageOS but available for use in rules.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add a label to a node:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;storageos node update --label-add storageos.com/deployment&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ce5c00;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;computeonly nodename
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;storageos-pod-labels&#34;&gt;StorageOS Pod Labels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Feature&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Label&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Values&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Fencing&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;storageos.com/fenced&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;true / false&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Enables StorageOS fencing of pods on unavailable nodes. For more information about fencing prerequisites please see the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/v1.x/docs/operations/fencing&#34;&gt;Fencing&lt;/a&gt; operations page.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add the fencing label to a pod use kubectl:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;kubectl label pod &amp;lt;POD_NAME&amp;gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#000&#34;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ce5c00;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;value
kubectl label pod mydb-pod storageos.com/fenced&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ce5c00;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#204a87&#34;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;storageos-pool-labels&#34;&gt;StorageOS Pool labels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pools do not have any labels present by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Feature&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Label&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Values&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Overcommitment&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;storageos.com/overcommit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;integers [+]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Sets the percentage of overcommitment allowed for the pool (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/v1.x/docs/operations/overcommitment/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add overcommit labels to a pool:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;storageos pool update --label-add storageos.com/overcommit&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ce5c00;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#0000cf;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt; default
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;storageos-volume-labels&#34;&gt;StorageOS Volume labels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volumes do not have any feature labels present by default&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Feature&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Label&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Values&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Caching&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;storageos.com/nocache&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;true / false&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Switches off caching.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Compression&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;storageos.com/nocompress&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;true / false&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Switches off compression of data at rest and in transit.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Encryption&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;storageos.com/encryption&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;true / false&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Enables volume encryption, more details &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/v1.x/docs/operations/encrypted-volumes&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Failure mode&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;storageos.com/failure.mode&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;strings [&lt;code&gt;soft&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;hard&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;alwayson&lt;/code&gt;]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Soft failure mode works together with the failure tolerance. Hard is a mode where any loss in desired replicas count will mark volume as unavailable. AlwaysOn is a mode where as long as master is alive volume will be writable.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Failure tolerance&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;storageos.com/failure.tolerance&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;integers [0, 4]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Specifies how many failed replicas to tolerate, defaults to (Replicas - 1) if Replicas &amp;gt; 0, so if there are 2 replicas it will default to 1.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Placement&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;storageos.com/hint.master&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Node hostname or uuid&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Requests master volume placement on the specified node.  Will use another node if request can&amp;rsquo;t be satisfied.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;QoS&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;storageos.com/throttle&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;true / false&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Deprioritizes traffic by reducing the rate of disk I/O, when true.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Replication&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;storageos.com/replicas&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;integers [0, 5]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Replicates entire volume across nodes. Typically 1 replica is sufficient (2 copies of the data); more than 2 replicas is not recommended.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create a volume with a feature label:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;storageos volume create --label storageos.com/throttle&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ce5c00;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#204a87&#34;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; --label storageos.com/replicas&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ce5c00;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#0000cf;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; volumename
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When using the Kubernetes CSI driver (available from Kubernetes 1.10), volume
labels can also be added to the parameters section of the StorageClass. This
means that all volumes created with the specific StorageClass will have
StorageOS volume labels applied to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example the StorageClass below will create &lt;code&gt;ext4&lt;/code&gt; formatted volumes with a
single StorageOS replica, in the &lt;code&gt;default&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/v1.x/docs/concepts/pools/&#34;&gt;pool&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34; data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#204a87;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;apiVersion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;storage.k8s.io/v1&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#204a87;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;kind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;StorageClass&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;

   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)

       the Derivative Works; and

   (d) If the Work includes a &amp;quot;NOTICE&amp;quot; text file as part of its

       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
   the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &amp;quot;AS IS&amp;quot; BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      source, and configuration files.

      &amp;quot;Object&amp;quot; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      &amp;quot;Work&amp;quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      &amp;quot;Derivative Works&amp;quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      &amp;quot;Contribution&amp;quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner

      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &amp;quot;submitted&amp;quot;
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as &amp;quot;Not a Contribution.&amp;quot;

      &amp;quot;Contributor&amp;quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a &amp;quot;NOTICE&amp;quot; text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &amp;quot;AS IS&amp;quot; BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,

      source, and configuration files.

      &amp;quot;Object&amp;quot; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      &amp;quot;Work&amp;quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      &amp;quot;Derivative Works&amp;quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      &amp;quot;Contribution&amp;quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &amp;quot;submitted&amp;quot;
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as &amp;quot;Not a Contribution.&amp;quot;

      &amp;quot;Contributor&amp;quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a &amp;quot;NOTICE&amp;quot; text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &amp;quot;AS IS&amp;quot; BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

     terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form
     of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how
     they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or
     restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
        of distribution to the recipient; and

     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,
        or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for
        the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’
        rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the
     Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software
     with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered
     Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits
     You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of
     such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at
     their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of
     either this License or such Secondary License(s).

3.4. Notices

     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including
     copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
     of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered
     Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent
     required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf
     of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
     warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You
     alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
     jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial
   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
   they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
   distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the
   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
   understand it.

5. Termination

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,
     if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.
     Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an
     ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by
     some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of
     non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become
     compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,
     and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or
     indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and
     all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License
     shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
     termination shall survive termination.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty

   Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without
   warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
   without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
   merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire
   risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.
   Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any
   Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or
   correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this
   License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License
   except under this disclaimer.

7. Limitation of Liability

   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
   party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
   Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

8. Litigation

   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of
   a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business
   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
   prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
   contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe
   this License against a Contributor.

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

     All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
     Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the
     terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form
     of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how
     they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or
     restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
        of distribution to the recipient; and

     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,
        or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for
        the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’
        rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the
     Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software
     with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered
     Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits
     You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of
     such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at
     their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of
     either this License or such Secondary License(s).

3.4. Notices

     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including
     copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
     of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered
     Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent
     required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf
     of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
     warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You
     alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
     jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial
   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
   they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
   distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the
   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
   understand it.

5. Termination

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,
     if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.
     Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an
     ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by
     some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of
     non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become
     compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,
     and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or
     indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and
     all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License
     shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
     termination shall survive termination.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty

   Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without
   warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
   without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
   merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire
   risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.
   Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any
   Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or
   correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this
   License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License
   except under this disclaimer.

7. Limitation of Liability

   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
   party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
   Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

8. Litigation

   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of
   a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business
   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
   prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
   contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe
   this License against a Contributor.

2. License Grants and Conditions

2.1. Grants

     Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
     non-exclusive license:

     a. under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
        Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
        modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
        Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
        as part of a Larger Work; and

     b. under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for
        sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
        Contributions or its Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date

     The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
     become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
     distributes such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

     The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
     this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
     distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
     Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
     Contributor:

     a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or

     b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party&#39;s
        modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
        Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
        Version); or

     c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
        its Contributions.

     This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
     or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
     the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

     No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
     distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
     License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
     permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

     Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
     Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to
     grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

     This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
     applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
     equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

     Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in
     Section 2.1.


3. Responsibilities

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

     All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
     Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
     the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
     Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
     License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
     attempt to alter or restrict the recipients&#39; rights in the Source Code
     Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
        of distribution to the recipient; and

     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
        License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
        license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the
        recipients&#39; rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
     the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
     Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
     Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
     License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
     under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
     the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
     Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
     License(s).

3.4. Notices

     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
     (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or
     limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the
     Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the
     extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
     behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
     such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
     You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
     jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute,
   judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of
   this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
   limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a
   text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under
   this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation,
   such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary
   skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing
     basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by
     some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into
     compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are
     reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the
     non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have
     received notice of non-compliance with this License from such
     Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt
     of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
     counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
     directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
     You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
     2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
     termination shall survive termination.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty

   Covered Software is provided under this License on an &amp;quot;as is&amp;quot; basis,
   without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory,
   including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free
   of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing.
   The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software
   is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect,
   You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,
   repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential
   part of this License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under
   this License except under this disclaimer.

7. Limitation of Liability

   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from
   such party&#39;s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such
   limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
   incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may
   not apply to You.

8. Litigation

   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts
   of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of
   business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
   jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing
   in this Section shall prevent a party&#39;s ability to bring cross-claims or
   counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
   matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
   unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
   necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that
   the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not
   be used to construe this License against a Contributor.


10. Versions of the License

10.1. New Versions

      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
      10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
      publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
      distinguishing version number.

10.2. Effect of New Versions

      You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
      of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
      or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
      steward.

10.3. Modified Versions

      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
      create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
      modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
      any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
      such modified license differs from this License).

10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
      Licenses If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is
      Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of
      the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be
      attached.

     non-exclusive license:

     a. under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
        Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
        modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
        Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as

     License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution
     or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section

     a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or

     b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s
        modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
        Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
        Version); or

     c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its
        Contributions.

     This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or
     logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the
     notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

     No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
     distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License
     (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted
     under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

     Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions
     are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the
     rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

     This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable
     copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

     Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in
     Section 2.1.


3. Responsibilities

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

     All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
     Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the
     terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form
     of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how
     they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or
     restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
        of distribution to the recipient; and

     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,
        or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for
        the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’
        rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the
     Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software
     with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered
     Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits
     You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of
     such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at
     their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of
     either this License or such Secondary License(s).

3.4. Notices

     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including
     copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
     of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered
     Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent
     required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf
     of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
     warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You
     alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
     jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial
   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
   they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
   distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the
   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
   understand it.

5. Termination

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,
     if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.
     Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an
     ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by
     some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of
     non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become
     compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,
     and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or
     indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and
     all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License
     shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
     termination shall survive termination.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty

   Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without
   warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
   without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
   merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire
   risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.
   Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any
   Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or
   correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this
   License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License
   except under this disclaimer.

7. Limitation of Liability

   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
   party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
   Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

8. Litigation

   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of
   a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business
   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
   prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
   contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe
   this License against a Contributor.


10. Versions of the License

10.1. New Versions

      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
      10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
      publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
      distinguishing version number.

10.2. Effect of New Versions

      You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of
      the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or
      under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
      steward.

10.3. Modified Versions

      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
      create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified
      version of this License if you rename the license and remove any
      references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such
      modified license differs from this License).

10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses
      If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With

        Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,

     License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution
     or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section
     2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:

     a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or

     b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s
        modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its

        Version); or

     c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its

     This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or
     logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the
     notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

     distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License
     (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted
     under the terms of Section 3.3).

     are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the
     rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

3. Responsibilities

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

     All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
     Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the
     terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form
     of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how
     they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or
     restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
        of distribution to the recipient; and

     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,
        or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for
        the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’
        rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the
     Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software
     with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered
     Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits
     You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of
     such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at
     their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of
     either this License or such Secondary License(s).

3.4. Notices

     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including
     copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
     of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered
     Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent
     required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf
     of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
     warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You
     alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
     jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial
   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
   they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
   distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the
   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
   understand it.

5. Termination

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,
     if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.
     Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an
     ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by
     some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of
     non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become
     compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,
     and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or
     indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and
     all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License
     shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
     termination shall survive termination.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty

   Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without
   warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
   without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
   merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire
   risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.
   Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any
   Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or
   correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this
   License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License
   except under this disclaimer.

7. Limitation of Liability

   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
   party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
   Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

8. Litigation

   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of
   a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business
   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
   prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
   contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe
   this License against a Contributor.


10. Versions of the License

10.1. New Versions

      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
      10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or

      steward.

10.3. Modified Versions

      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
      create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified

      references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such
      modified license differs from this License).

   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
   party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
   Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

8. Litigation

   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of
   a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business
   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
   prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
   contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe
   this License against a Contributor.

2. License Grants and Conditions

2.1. Grants

     Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
     non-exclusive license:

     a. under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
        Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
        modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
        Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as

     effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes
     such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

     License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution
     or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section
     2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:

     a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or

     b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s
        modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
        Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
        Version); or

     c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its
        Contributions.

     This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or
     logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the
     notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

     No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
     distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License
     (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted
     under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

     Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions
     are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the
     rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

     This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable
     copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

     Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in
     Section 2.1.


3. Responsibilities

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

     All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
     Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the
     terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form
     of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how
     they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or
     restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
        of distribution to the recipient; and

     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,
        or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for
        the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’
        rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the
     Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software
     with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered
     Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits
     You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of
     such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at
     their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of
     either this License or such Secondary License(s).

3.4. Notices

     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including
     copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
     of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered
     Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent
     required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf
     of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
     warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You
     alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
     jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial
   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
   they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
   distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the
   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
   understand it.

5. Termination

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,
     if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.
     Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an
     ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by
     some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of
     non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become
     compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,
     and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or
     indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and
     all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License
     shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
     termination shall survive termination.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty

   Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without
   warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
   without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
   merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire
   risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.
   Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any
   Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or
   correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this
   License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License
   except under this disclaimer.

7. Limitation of Liability

   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
   party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
   Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

8. Litigation

   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of
   a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business
   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
   prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
   contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe
   this License against a Contributor.

     (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted
     under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

     Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions
     are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the
     rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

     This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable
     copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

     Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in
     Section 2.1.


3. Responsibilities

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

     All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
     Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the
     terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form
     of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how
     they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or
     restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
        of distribution to the recipient; and

     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,
        or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for
        the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’
        rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the
     Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software
     with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered
     Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits
     You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of
     such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at
     their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of
     either this License or such Secondary License(s).

3.4. Notices

     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including
     copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
     of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered
     Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent
     required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf
     of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
     warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You
     alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
     jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial
   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
   they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
   distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the
   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
   understand it.

5. Termination

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,
     if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.
     Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an
     ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by
     some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of
     non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become
     compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,
     and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or
     indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and
     all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License
     shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
     termination shall survive termination.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty

   Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without
   warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
   without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
   merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire
   risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.
   Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any
   Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or
   correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this
   License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License
   except under this disclaimer.

7. Limitation of Liability

   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
   party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
   Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

8. Litigation

   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of
   a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business
   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
   prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
   contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe
   this License against a Contributor.


10. Versions of the License

10.1. New Versions

      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
      10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
      publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
      distinguishing version number.

10.2. Effect of New Versions

      You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of
      the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or
      under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
      steward.

10.3. Modified Versions

      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
      create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified
      version of this License if you rename the license and remove any
      references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such
      modified license differs from this License).

10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses
      If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
      Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
      notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.

Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice

      This Source Code Form is subject to the
      terms of the Mozilla Public License, v.
      2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not
      distributed with this file, You can
      obtain one at
      http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.

If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then
You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant
directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.

You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

Exhibit B - “Incompatible With Secondary Licenses” Notice

      This Source Code Form is “Incompatible
      With Secondary Licenses”, as defined by
      the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.

        &lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&#34;https://prometheus.io&#34;&gt;Prometheus&lt;/a&gt; endpoint exposes metrics about
StorageOS artefacts (such as volumes), as well as internal StorageOS
components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customers may scrape these metrics using Prometheus itself, or any compatible client, such as the popular &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/telegraf/&#34;&gt;Telegraf&lt;/a&gt; agent shipped with InfluxDB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;artefact-metrics&#34;&gt;Artefact Metrics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artefact metrics are those which instrument a specific StorageOS artefact. Typically these relate to volumes. These are useful for general purpose monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volume metrics make use of the following StorageOS logical concepts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frontend - the layer serving a volume to an application. Always on the same host as the application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Network - the layer serving IO to remote volumes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backend - the layer representing IO to/from physical media. Not necessarily on the same host as an application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;table&gt;

      <title>Docs: Release notes</title>
      <link>https://docs.storageos.com/v1.x/docs/reference/release_notes/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://docs.storageos.com/v1.x/docs/reference/release_notes/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;We recommend always using &amp;ldquo;tagged&amp;rdquo; versions of StorageOS rather than &amp;ldquo;latest&amp;rdquo;,
and to perform upgrades only after reading the release notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest tagged release is &lt;code&gt;1.5.4&lt;/code&gt;, available from
&lt;a href=&#34;https://hub.docker.com/r/storageos/node/&#34;&gt;Docker Hub&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;code&gt;storageos/node:1.5.4&lt;/code&gt;, or via the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/storageos/charts&#34;&gt;Helm
Chart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest CLI release is &lt;code&gt;1.2.2&lt;/code&gt;, available from
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/storageos/go-cli/releases&#34;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;upgrading&#34;&gt;Upgrading&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/v1.x/docs/operations/upgrades/&#34;&gt;upgrades&lt;/a&gt; for upgrade strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;154---released-20200819&#34;&gt;1.5.4 - Released 2020/08/19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fixed&#34;&gt;Fixed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a CSI volume create request expires before completing, the retry operation
may not succeed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When detaching NFS volumes, return success if the volume has already been
deleted.  This avoids Kubernetes retrying the operation indefinitely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t overlap /var/lib/kubelet mount.  This could result in multiple entries
for &lt;code&gt;/var/lib/storageos&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;/etc/fstab&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set fsid_device to false so that NFS does not use local device major/minor
numbers for filesystem descriptors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run CSI containers as privileged.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pass cluster node selector to NFS pods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As an additional safeguard, check that the StorageOS device contains only
zeros in the first 256KB before running &lt;code&gt;mkfs&lt;/code&gt;.  &lt;code&gt;blkid&lt;/code&gt; is also still used to
check for existing filesystems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduced writes to etcd for health checks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed error &amp;ldquo;failed to detach volumes&amp;rdquo; &amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;resource name may not be empty&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;153---released-20200125&#34;&gt;1.5.3 - Released 2020/01/25&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fixed-1&#34;&gt;Fixed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resolved misrepresentation of internal metrics for licensed clusters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;152---released-20191218&#34;&gt;1.5.2 - Released 2019/12/18&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adds support for Kubernetes 1.17 and CSI 1.2.  Also reduces node container size
by 70%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;new&#34;&gt;New&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;storageos/node&lt;/code&gt; container size reduced by removing extraneous contents.  This
reduces the amount of time required to install and boostrap a new cluster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kubernetes 1.17.0 supported, resolving &lt;code&gt;cannot get resource &amp;quot;leases&amp;quot; in API group &amp;quot;coordination.k8s.io&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; permission issue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now supports version 1.2.0 of the CSI specification.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;improved&#34;&gt;Improved&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSI helpers updated to latest versions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;operator-sdk&lt;/code&gt; dependency updated to version 0.12.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Downgraded some log messages for transient failures from error to info.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fixed-2&#34;&gt;Fixed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resolved documentation inconsistency between Openshift Marketplace and
docs.storageos.com.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Node label update now retries if the node is not yet known to StorageOS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;151---released-20191126&#34;&gt;1.5.1 - Released 2019/11/26&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixes a permission error on Kubernetes 1.16 and improves reporting of
Pod scheduling failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;new-1&#34;&gt;New&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The [cluster-operator] now reports internal metrics suitable for scraping with
Prometheus on &lt;code&gt;http://0.0.0.0:8686/metrics&lt;/code&gt;.  If Prometheus has been installed
in the cluster using the [prometheus-operator], then &lt;code&gt;ServiceMonitor&lt;/code&gt;
resources will be created to register the endpoint automatically.  See
[prometheus-setup] for an example Prometheus installation.  Currently only the
default process metrics are reported but we intend to improve coverage over
the next few releases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;improved-1&#34;&gt;Improved&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pod scheduling failures are now registered as Pod events to provide
contextual error messages.  Before, only HTTP status codes could be reported
since that was the only information that could be passed via &lt;code&gt;kube-scheduler&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leader election has been added to [cluster-operator] and &amp;ldquo;leader-for-life&amp;rdquo;
enabled by default.  In the future, this will allow multiple instances of the
operator to be running simultaneously.  For now, only a single instance is
supported.  See [leader-election] for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The [cluster-operator] now fully implements status phases.  This means that
Kubernetes and &lt;code&gt;kubectl&lt;/code&gt; now report the following statuses for
&lt;code&gt;StorageOSCluster&lt;/code&gt; resources:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Pending&lt;/code&gt; cluster status when the requirements are unmet.  New clusters may
wait in &lt;code&gt;Pending&lt;/code&gt; state while there is an existing cluster running.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Creating&lt;/code&gt; cluster status when the provisioning has started.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Running&lt;/code&gt; cluster status for a provisioned cluster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Terminating&lt;/code&gt; cluster status when a cluster delete has been initiated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Updated the [cluster-operator] base image to latest &lt;code&gt;ubi8/ubi-minimal&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fixed-3&#34;&gt;Fixed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixed permission errors in Kubernetes 1.16:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Failed to list *v1beta1.CSINode: csinodes.storage.k8s.io is forbidden&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;&#39;events.events.k8s.io is forbidden&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deployments using embedded etcd could fail to bootstrap when Kubernetes
returns multiple addresses for a node.  Previously, the first address in the
list was assumed to be the address that the nodes should communicate on.
Instead, we now prefer to use the &lt;code&gt;InternalIP&lt;/code&gt; address, and if that is not
found, the first address used as before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;150---released-20191112&#34;&gt;1.5.0 - Released 2019/11/12&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with a 10x improvement in sequential read performance, version &lt;code&gt;1.5.0&lt;/code&gt;
adds two much-requested features; Pod Locality and Shared Filesytems (RWX).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;new-2&#34;&gt;New&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pod Locality improves application performance by placing workloads in close
proximity to its data.  In the default configuration, and when resources
permit, StorageOS will instruct Kubernetes to prefer placing the workload on
the node holding the master copy of the data, and then prefer the replicas.
Where this is not possible, any other healthy node running StorageOS will be
considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pod Locality is enabled by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See [Pod locality]({{ ref &amp;ldquo;docs/concepts/podlocality.md&amp;rdquo; &amp;gt;}}) for more
information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shared Filesystem support allows StorageOS volumes to be provisioned for read
&amp;amp; write access by multiple Pods concurrently.  Using the same StorageOS
StorageClass, PVC requests can now specify
&lt;a href=&#34;https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#access-modes&#34;&gt;AccessMode&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;code&gt;ReadWriteMany&lt;/code&gt; (RWX) for shared filesystem, or &lt;code&gt;ReadWriteOnce&lt;/code&gt; (RWO) for a
standard volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volume features such as replication, encryption and caching can be applied to
RWX volumes by using PVC labels and StorageClass parameters in the same way as
with RWO volumes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each shared filesystem is exposed via a dedicated service, named after the PVC
name.  The service also exposes Prometheus metrics for the shared volume on
&lt;code&gt;http://&amp;lt;service&amp;gt;:80/metrics&lt;/code&gt;.  When Prometheus has been deployed using the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator&#34;&gt;Prometheus Operator&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/blob/master/Documentation/user-guides/getting-started.md#related-resources&#34;&gt;ServiceMonitor&lt;/a&gt;
resources are automatically created for each endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shared filesystem support is only available when using the CSI driver, which
is the recommended deployment method from Kubernetes 1.12 onwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Shared Filesystem support has been tested by customers in our Beta
Programme and we are not aware of any critical issues, we are releasing the
feature as a Technology Preview.  We encourage all users to test Shared
Filesystem support and let us know of any issues or how it can be improved
before we recommend it for production workloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/v1.x/docs/concepts/sharedfs/&#34;&gt;Shared filesystems&lt;/a&gt; for more
information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;improved-2&#34;&gt;Improved&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read performance for all workload types and block sizes have been improved,
with sequential workloads now 10x faster than version &lt;code&gt;1.4.0&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remote read performance for large block sizes has also been substantially
improved with optimizations to reduce round trips, increasing throughput and
lowering overall latency. Remote writes for large block sizes have already
been optimized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Block checksums are now stored with the volume metadata.  While not exposed as
features in &lt;code&gt;1.5.0&lt;/code&gt;, replica consistency can now be quickly proven and
corruptions corrected.  Existing volumes will not be affected, only newly
created volumes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The dataplane log parser has been replaced and is now more efficient, and
handles embedded quotes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Telemetry now uses gRPC over TLS.  The existing Sentry-based telemetry will be
phased out.  Telemetry can be disabled by setting &lt;code&gt;DISABLE_TELEMETRY=true&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fixed-4&#34;&gt;Fixed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encrypted volumes did not always respect the compression setting, resulting in
capacity savings being lower than expected.  Unlike most storage systems,
StorageOS is able to compress data prior to encrypting it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;other&#34;&gt;Other&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maximum provisioned capacity of an unregistered cluster (default install)
has been reduced from 100GB to 50GB.  We have made this change to encourage
users to register for the free Developer licence, which grants 500GB of
provisioned capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through cluster registrations we are able to get a better understanding of who
is using StorageOS and which events or referrals are most effective.  We would
love to understand your challenges and any ideas you may have to improve
StorageOS.  You may unsubscribe from our mailing list at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;140---released-20190906&#34;&gt;1.4.0 - Released 2019/09/06&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Version &lt;code&gt;1.4.0&lt;/code&gt; changes the way metadata keys are stored on disk resulting in
improved key locality and thus an increase in IO performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;IMPORTANT:&lt;/em&gt; Due to the nature of this change, the upgrade process includes an
automated conversion process. If upgrading from &lt;code&gt;1.3.0&lt;/code&gt; or below, please ensure
you follow the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/v1.x/docs/operations/upgrades/&#34;&gt;upgrade instructions&lt;/a&gt;.
If the upgrade process is not followed, version &lt;code&gt;1.4.0&lt;/code&gt; will refuse to start,
but you may restart using the previous version. Once the upgrade process has
been completed it is not possible to revert to an earlier version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No new features will be added to the &lt;code&gt;1.4&lt;/code&gt; series and we will instead release a
&lt;code&gt;1.5.0-rc1&lt;/code&gt; in the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;improved-3&#34;&gt;Improved&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved performance for sequential IO greater than 4k in size by changing
the ordering of metadata keys so that the volume inode is in the most
significant bits, followed by the offset.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volume deletes are now 5 - 20x faster, and for &amp;lt;10GB volumes should take less
than a second.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fixed-5&#34;&gt;Fixed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Prometheus metrics endpoint no longer displays statistics for volumes
that have been deleted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;130---released-20190708&#34;&gt;1.3.0 - Released 2019/07/08&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;1.3.0&lt;/code&gt; release contains further substantial performance improvements,
particularly for workloads that can parallelise IO or when multiple volumes are
performing high rates of IO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;new-3&#34;&gt;New&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switched internal device presentation from FUSE to TCMU when the kernel
supports it, and when no conflicting TCMU-based devices already exist.  TCMU
improves performance in all use cases, but particularly when queue depths are
greater than 1.  TCMU can be disabled by setting &lt;code&gt;disableTCMU: true&lt;/code&gt;, and it
can be forced by setting &lt;code&gt;forceTCMU: true&lt;/code&gt;.  When &lt;code&gt;forceTCMU: true&lt;/code&gt; has been
set and either the kernel does not support TCMU or there are conflicting
devices, then StorageOS will refuse to start.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The operator now runs an additional scheduler Pod, which can be disabled by
setting &lt;code&gt;disableScheduler: true&lt;/code&gt; in the StorageOS CR.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;improved-4&#34;&gt;Improved&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The admin user&amp;rsquo;s username and password are no longer stored in the KV store
and are now always read from the &lt;code&gt;ADMIN_USERNAME&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ADMIN_PASSWORD&lt;/code&gt;
environment variables which are populated by the secret from &lt;code&gt;secretRefName&lt;/code&gt;.
Previously, the environment variables were only read on cluster bootstrap.
This caused problems when re-installing a cluster as the previous credentials
were cached in the KV store and the credentials set in the environment
variables would not work.  It is no longer required to clear
&lt;code&gt;/var/lib/storageos&lt;/code&gt; between re-installs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replication ACK timeouts have be reduced from 15 to 3 seconds to allow
retries to be performed sooner.  The overall timeout remains the same.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Telemetry now reports the Kubernetes version and the distribution name if set
in the &lt;code&gt;k8sDistro&lt;/code&gt; environment variable.  This information helps us direct
focus on the most relevant platforms.  As always, telemetry reporting can be
disabled by setting &lt;code&gt;disableTelemetry: true&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low-level dataplane configuration is now included in the diagnostics bundle.
The bundle can only be created by the cluster administrator and can be
uploaded to assist with support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logging for the Operator has been reworked to allow easier troubleshooting
and consistency with other operators using Kubernetes&amp;rsquo; &lt;code&gt;controller-runtime&lt;/code&gt;
library.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fixed-6&#34;&gt;Fixed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When creating volumes in stress test conditions, it was possible to be
re-allocated the inode of a volume that had not yet finished the deletion
process, causing the create to fail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When issuing an unmount request using the CSI driver, the operation would fail
if the volume was already unmounted.  The operation now returns success and
allows a remount to succeed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;121---released-20190515&#34;&gt;1.2.1 - Released 2019/05/15&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.2.1 is primarily a bug fix release, but it also includes some performance
improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;improved-5&#34;&gt;Improved&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performance tuning on the metadata store, improving performance for sustained
writes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Metadata checksums now use a pipelined SSE algorithm to improve performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set SCSI timeouts for StorageOS volumes to 120 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More robust handling of devices on first initialisation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volumes created with CSI are now formatted with lazy initialization enabled,
reducing the time taken to provision the volume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logging for volume detach operations when fencing a Pod.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cluster maintenance logging improved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fixed-7&#34;&gt;Fixed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved handling of in-memory cache during repeated failover events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a volume was being deleted while there was IO pending to an offline
remote node, the delete would wait until the IO timed out.  IO is now
abandoned when a volume is deleted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During shutdown, IO to offline remote nodes would be retried, causing shutdown
to take longer than needed. Now, unsuccessful IO is marked as failed
immediately if a shutdown has been requested.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The network client is now shutdown before the block presentation layer so that
threads with pending IO are immediately unblocked. This helps ensure shutdowns
can finish gracefully within the 10 second window set by the orchestrator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Node inspect output did not show all configuration information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When CSI is enabled, devices are now created on all nodes instead of on
demand. This mitigates a timing issue and allows faster failover.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replication logs could contain incorrect volume identifiers when multiple
syncs are in progress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;120---released-20190417&#34;&gt;1.2.0 - Released 2019/04/17&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;1.2.0&lt;/code&gt; release contains significant performance and resource utilisation
improvements, along with 3 new features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pod fencing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volume Encryption&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;etcd TLS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;new-4&#34;&gt;New&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pod fencing can improve application failover times, particularly for
applications deployed as StatefulSets.  When the label
&lt;code&gt;storageos.com/fenced=true&lt;/code&gt; is applied to a Pod, that mounts a replicated
StorageOS volume, and StorageOS detects that the node running the Pod is
offline, it will tell Kubernetes to re-schedule the Pod elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without this feature, Kubernetes will by default wait 5 minutes before marking
the node offline and performing remedial actions.  When applications are
deployed as StatefulSets then manual intervention is also required before Pods
will be re-scheduled. This behaviour guards against multiple nodes accessing
the same volume concurrently as Kubernetes does not have visibility of
storage presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since StorageOS detects and remediates node failure more aggressively (in
30-40 seconds) and it protects against multiple nodes accessing volumes
concurrently, the fencing option gives the ability to override the default
Kubernetes behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/v1.x/docs/concepts/fencing/&#34;&gt;fencing&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volume Encryption can now be enabled by setting the
&lt;code&gt;storageos.com/encryption=true&lt;/code&gt; label on a volume.  When enabled, data will be
encrypted prior to being persisted on disk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/v1.x/docs/concepts/encryption/&#34;&gt;encrypted volumes&lt;/a&gt; for more
information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mutual TLS is now supported on external etcd KV backends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/v1.x/docs/operations/external-etcd/etcd-tls/&#34;&gt;etcd TLS&lt;/a&gt; for more
information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When deployed using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/storageos/cluster-operator&#34;&gt;StorageOS Cluster
Operator&lt;/a&gt;, node labels from
Kubernetes are visible within StorageOS and available for use in rules.  This
is particularly useful to mark specific nodes as compute-only.  See
&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/v1.x/docs/reference/labels/&#34;&gt;labels&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;improved-6&#34;&gt;Improved&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple significant performance improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple data plane processes were merged into a single &lt;code&gt;dataplane&lt;/code&gt; binary.
This has multiple benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved performance by reducing context switches when passing data
between processes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easier to instrument and trace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Startup and shutdown logic simpler to manage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DirectFS, the network communication layer used by replication and remote
volumes, has been largely re-written and now uses a connection pool to reduce
memory overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several log formatting and level improvements to provide more relevant and
consistent messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gossip (serf) port added to the network connectivity heath check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fixed-8&#34;&gt;Fixed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CLI command &lt;code&gt;storageos cluster health&lt;/code&gt; now returns more useful information
about the health of the cluster and does not require the cluster ID or join
token to be supplied as a parameter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When changing the cluster log level at run-time using &lt;code&gt;storageos logs --log-level debug&lt;/code&gt;, the new log level would be applied but an incorrect error
would be returned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;115---released-20190329&#34;&gt;1.1.5 - Released 2019/03/29&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Version 1.1.5 is an interim bugfix release as we continue to test the upcoming
1.2 feature release internally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;improved-7&#34;&gt;Improved&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Previously we would allocate 5% of free memory to use as cache. On larger
systems that were being rebooted, we could use more memory than intended if we
start before other applications do. We now set a hard upper-bound of 512MB.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cluster ID is now logged more prominently during startup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Labels prefixed with &lt;code&gt;kubernetes.io/&lt;/code&gt; are now accepted. This allows core
Kubernetes labels to be inherited and used for scheduling decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A cache flush is now triggered when &lt;code&gt;fsck&lt;/code&gt; is run on a volume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removed noisy log messages from the dataplane stats module.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased log level to &lt;code&gt;info&lt;/code&gt; for volume create and delete with CSI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fixed-9&#34;&gt;Fixed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mounting a volume while the volume was undergoing a series of configuration
updates could cause the mount to hang.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When increasing the number of replicas for a mounted volume, the new replica
could get stuck in &amp;ldquo;provisioned&amp;rdquo; state. Removing the stuck replica and
re-trying would normally clear the issue. The root cause has now been fixed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a volume was being deleted and the data scrub finished, if there was an
error removing the volume configuration from the kv store (e.g. kv store
unavailable), it would log an error and not retry. Now, the operation is
re-tried.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The soft and hard mode failure detection was incorrectly using the count of
failed replicas in the calculation, not the active replicas. When new replicas
are being provisioned it&amp;rsquo;s normal to have more than the requested number of
replicas with some of them pending removal. The logic was changed to count
healthy replicas instead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed excessive log messages when removing a device for a volume that still
exists elsewhere in the cluster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The UI incorrectly counted the replica stuck in &amp;ldquo;provisioned&amp;rdquo; state as
available when it did not yet have a consistent copy of the the data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When setting the cluster log level via the CLI, an error was returned even
though the update suceeded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The UI was displaying storage capacity in GB rather than GiB.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the UI, the volume delete hover was missing, causing the button to appear
disabled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding a label to a volume in the UI could insert the string &amp;ldquo;undefined&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;114---released-20190306&#34;&gt;1.1.4 - Released 2019/03/06&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Includes a single fix to increase the time we wait for the operating system to
create a new block device.  On some platforms (cloud providers in particular)
the variation can be wider than expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fixed-10&#34;&gt;Fixed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Address device creation delays on certain platforms/distributions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;113---released-20190301&#34;&gt;1.1.3 - Released 2019/03/01&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Version 1.1.3 is a bugfix and usability release.  Please upgrade if you are
using external etcd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;new-5&#34;&gt;New&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are no new features.  Look out for 1.2 coming soon!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;improved-8&#34;&gt;Improved&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When using an external etcd KV store and it becomes inaccessible, StorageOS is
now more resilient.  All volumes remain online and usable but configuration
changes are restricted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added a warning in the UI if cluster nodes are running different StorageOS
versions.  The warning includes a link to the upgrade documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cluster ID is now more prominent in the UI.  The cluster ID is required
for licensing and support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UI login failure notifications are now automatically dismissed after a
successful login.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved error handling and logging when configuring volumes in the data
plane.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strict dependency checking when configuring volumes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fixed-11&#34;&gt;Fixed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When refreshing the volumes page in the UI could return a &amp;ldquo;volume not found&amp;rdquo;
error.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When editing volume labels in the UI, there is now a confirmation check before
removing a label.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed a bug that might prevent a volume delete request from being actioned.
This would appear as a volume that is stuck in deleting state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;112---released-20190203&#34;&gt;1.1.2 - Released 2019/02/03&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.1.2 improves stability when nodes lose network connectivity intermittenly by
introducing a new grace period before performing node recovery operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;breaking-changes&#34;&gt;Breaking changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The environment variables introduced in version &lt;code&gt;1.1.1&lt;/code&gt; to tune node failure
detection have changed. Previously &lt;code&gt;PROBE_INTERVAL_MS&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;PROBE_TIMEOUT_MS&lt;/code&gt;
were set to a number of milliseconds.  They have now been replaced with
&lt;code&gt;PROBE_INTERVAL&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;PROBE_TIMEOUT&lt;/code&gt;, which takes a time duration in string
format, e.g. &lt;code&gt;500ms&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;2s&lt;/code&gt;.  We believe this change gives slightly more
flexibility and is easier to use.  Going forward, all duration-based
configuration will use this format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;new-6&#34;&gt;New&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When network connectivity to a node is confirmed lost, there is now a
configurable grace period before recovery operations begin.  The grace period
allows time for the network or node to recover from short interruptions.  The
default is set to &lt;code&gt;30s&lt;/code&gt;.  The minimum duration is &lt;code&gt;0s&lt;/code&gt;, and the maximum is
&lt;code&gt;90s&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the UI, a button has been added to re-send the activation email when
requesting a Developer licence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;improved-9&#34;&gt;Improved&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logs now use nanosecond precision for timestamps.  This helps ensure the
correct ordering when logging to an external source such as Elasticsearch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upgraded Golang compiler to version &lt;code&gt;1.11.5&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support diagnostics can now be generated while nodes are waiting to join the
cluster.  This can help troubleshoot dependency or network connectivity issues
that are blocking successful startup.  This feature is currently only enabled
in the API; in a future release it will be exposed in the UI and CLI.  To
generate the diagnostics bundle, run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;curl -o diagnostics.tar storageos:storageos@localhost:5705/v1/diagnostics/cluster
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Added more context to error logs when there is a failure to configure the
dataplane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Added more logging at debug level when gossip detected a node&amp;rsquo;s health change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fixed-12&#34;&gt;Fixed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When CSI is enabled, if a volume was created in a namespace that did not
already exist, then the create operation would fail.  Now the namespace is
created as part of the volume create operation.  This matches the behaviour of
the Kubernetes native driver.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When importing Kubernetes ABAC policy files, the jsonl format was incorrectly
detected and input was incorrectly parsed as json, which would not validate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;111---released-20190121&#34;&gt;1.1.1 - Released 2019/01/21&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.1.1 contains a critical bugfix in the etcd client library that could cause
the StorageOS control plane to become unresponsive when etcd is unavailable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;new-7&#34;&gt;New&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exposed tuning knobs for node failure detection via two new environment
variables:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;PROBE_INTERVAL_MS&lt;/code&gt;: the interval in milliseconds between node probes.
Setting this lower (more frequent) will cause the cluster to detect failed
nodes more quickly at the expense of increased bandwidth usage.  Defaults to
1000ms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;PROBE_TIMEOUT_MS&lt;/code&gt;: the timeout to wait for an ack from a probed node before
assuming it is unhealthy.  This should be set to 99-percentile of RTT
(round-trip time) on your network.  Defaults to 3000ms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defaults should be appropriate for most environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;improvements&#34;&gt;Improvements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a node is determined to be offline by &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hashicorp/memberlist&#34;&gt;memberlist&lt;/a&gt;,
we now verify by sending a TCP handshake from the scheduler to the node&amp;rsquo;s
replication port.  If the handshake is successful we abort the process to mark
the node offline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the StorageOS container was killed, we now log at error level instead of
debug level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The UI now gives user feedback when a diagnostics bundle is being uploaded or
downloaded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volume details and &lt;code&gt;dmesg&lt;/code&gt; output is now collected in the diagnostics bundle.
This information helps our engineers diagnose issues more easily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internal cleanup of API handlers and middleware.  API errors now follow
consistent formatting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Values for CSI parameters &lt;code&gt;VolumeId&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;VolumePath&lt;/code&gt; are now validated to
ensure they are not empty.  This is internal to the interaction between
the orchestrator and StorageOS and applies to the &lt;code&gt;GetVolumeStats()&lt;/code&gt; CSI call.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removed spammy &amp;ldquo;failed to retrieve volume capacity stats&amp;rdquo; log message when a
volume was in the process of being deleted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a node is rebuilt and re-added to the cluster, manual steps must be taken
to ensure that a previous (now invalid) config is not re-applied to the new
node as it may not have the previous backend data.  The log messages now
better explain the issue and the steps required to resolve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better error logging when data plane configuration was not applied.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fixed-13&#34;&gt;Fixed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updated the etcd client library to version 3.3.11, which includes a fix for
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/9578,&#34;&gt;https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/9578,&lt;/a&gt; a tight loop in the reconnect
logic when a watch loses its connection to the etcd server.  The loop would
cause the control plane to become unresponsive, including not allowing it to
respond to healthchecks, which could result in the node being taken offline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed an issue in the etcd watcher when we specify an object version to
use as a starting point to watch for change from, but that version no longer
exists in etcd due to scheduled compaction of the etcd datastore.  Now, the
error is caught and retried from the latest version.  The error was logged as:
&lt;code&gt;etcdserver: mvcc: required revision has been compacted&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The diagnostics bundle was saving with the extension &lt;code&gt;.tar.gz&lt;/code&gt;, even though
it is not compressed.  It now saves as &lt;code&gt;.tar&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a node was heavily loaded, it was possible for volume delete requests to
get stuck.  The delete result processing is now done in a separate thread from
the request so that a long request can&amp;rsquo;t block receiving responses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;110---released-20190104&#34;&gt;1.1.0 - Released 2019/01/04&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.1.0 adds support for &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec&#34;&gt;CSI 1.0&lt;/a&gt;
and includes some minor bug fixes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;new-8&#34;&gt;New&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSI 1.0 (available in Kubernetes 1.13 onwards) is now fully supported.
Backwards compatibility with earlier versions of CSI and Kubernetes has been
maintained and is the default.  CSI 1.0 support is automatically enabled when
using the StorageOS &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/storageos/cluster-operator&#34;&gt;cluster-operator&lt;/a&gt;
on Kubernetes 1.13 and above.  If installing manually, set the &lt;code&gt;CSI_VERSION&lt;/code&gt;
environment variable to &lt;code&gt;v1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;improvements-1&#34;&gt;Improvements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the UI, the namespaces in the dropdown list are now sorted in alphabetical
order.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removed spammy log messages for IO size.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When creating a volume using CSI, the namespace can be set by adding a
&lt;code&gt;volumenamespace&lt;/code&gt; label to the StorageClass.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fixed-14&#34;&gt;Fixed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloud provider detection could cause a panic in non-AWS environments that
respond on the same metadata ip address that AWS uses.  Fixed in
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/pull/2380&#34;&gt;aws-sdk-go&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refreshing the UI caused the selected namespace to be reset.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;102---released-20181210&#34;&gt;1.0.2 - Released 2018/12/10&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.0.2 includes a fix required for Azure AKS and several other fixes and
improvements, many to help with running on low-memory or heavily loaded servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;improvements-2&#34;&gt;Improvements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cache allocation has been adjusted for lower memory systems.  Allocation sizes
are described in &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/v1.x/docs/concepts/architecture/&#34;&gt;architecture&lt;/a&gt;.
The cache size will never be set to more than 1/3rd of free memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased the maximum number of replicas from 4 to 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased the timeout for the device presentation shutdown to 9 seconds before
sending a &lt;code&gt;SIGKILL&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased the wait timeout for dataplane startup from 10 to 30 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Added colour-coded health labels in the UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rules can now be enabled and disabled in the UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improved input validation in the UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IO error handling log messages are now more informative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-fatal (re-tryable) errors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Can&#39;t resolve replica inode configuration on local director&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Can&#39;t resolve master inode configuration on the remote director&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Can&#39;t resolve replica inode configuration on the remote director&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;The client does not have the appropriate configuration&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;No connection could be found&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fatal errors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Generic fatal error (use this if there is no need to be specific)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Can&#39;t resolve master inode configuration on the local director&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;ENOSPC error&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Blobs corrupt/missing/not-sane etc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;A shm-pipe operation fatally failed&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Read only volume&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Sentinel value&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corrected confusing log message: &lt;code&gt;poll() returned error on network socket: Success&lt;/code&gt;.
We now log: &lt;code&gt;connection closed&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better logging when testing system device capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better logging for dataplane status errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fixed-15&#34;&gt;Fixed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Azure AKS, StorageOS could fail to restart.  This was caused by an error in
the system device capabilities verification incorrectly determining that the
node didn&amp;rsquo;t meet prerequisites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During startup, it was possible to retrieve an uninitialized value from a
dataplane status endpoint, which caused startup to fail.  This was only seen
on heavily-loaded systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Potential deadlock in dynamic cache resize.  This is not known to have
occured.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During a scheduler failover, it was possible to miss a node recovery gossip
message and the node would never be marked as recovered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was possible for a volume to get a volume stuck in &lt;code&gt;syncing&lt;/code&gt; state if a KV
watcher was interrupted.  Now, full state from the KV store is re-evaluated
every 10 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When creating a volume using CSI, the pool field was ignored.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;101---released-20181123&#34;&gt;1.0.1 - Released 2018/11/23&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is primarily a bugfix release to better handle node recovery behaviour when
network connectivity is re-established.  There are also a few minor bugfixes and
general improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;improvements-3&#34;&gt;Improvements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upgraded UI to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://cli.vuejs.org/&#34;&gt;Vue CLI 3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is no longer possible for a user to delete their own account, or for an
administrator to downgrade their access to a normal user.  This ensures that
there is always at least one cluster administrator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When making volume placement decisions, the scheduler will now apply a lower
ranking score to nodes that have come online less than 5 minutes ago.  This
allows the node to perform most recovery operations prior to accepting new
volumes.  This will not cause volume placement to be delayed, only that
non-recovering nodes will be preferred.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cluster diagnostics bundle can now be downloaded via the Web UI in
addition to uploading for StorageOS support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The volume list in the Web UI now shows more detailed volume health.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dataplane metrics now use less memory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fixed-16&#34;&gt;Fixed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a node was partitioned as a result of a network failure, it would not
always rejoin the cluster when the network was restored.  Nodes now
attempt to reconnect via gossip every 2 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dataplane process metrics (e.g. memory usage) were not being exposed via
the Prometheus &lt;code&gt;/metrics&lt;/code&gt; endpoint.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;storageos logs -f&lt;/code&gt; CLI command was incorrectly reporting all log entries at
&lt;code&gt;fatal&lt;/code&gt; level, overwriting the correct log level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed errors in Web UI when API not yet available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;100---released-20181115&#34;&gt;1.0.0 - Released 2018/11/15&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.0.0 is suitable for production workloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;new-9&#34;&gt;New&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offline nodes can now be removed from management either by using the CLI &lt;code&gt;node delete&lt;/code&gt; command, or in the UI. This is only available when external etcd is
used as the KV store.  See
&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/v1.x/docs/operations/decommission-nodes/&#34;&gt;decommissioning nodes&lt;/a&gt;
for more information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nodes can now be placed into &amp;ldquo;Maintenance mode&amp;rdquo; to disable volume recovery on
the node while it is offline for maintenance. This allows nodes to be
upgraded without triggering potentially unwanted data migrations. Note that
applications accessing StorageOS volumes on the node should also be shutdown.
Alternatively, you may move applications off the node and use
&lt;code&gt;stoageos node drain&lt;/code&gt; to migrate data prior to taking the node offline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5% of backend volume capacity is now reserved for indexes and recovery.  This
helps ensure that there is enough remaining capacity to perform recovery
operations such as deleting or moving frontend volumes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prometheus metrics for volume used capacity, and added to the API volume
objects and the UI. A placeholder for actual used capacity (after
compression) has also been added but is not yet provided.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the UI, storage pools and nodes now have an additional details page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added group management to the UI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The overprovisioning ratio can now be configured on pools by applying the
label &lt;code&gt;storageos.com/overcommit&lt;/code&gt; to a positive integer representing the
overcommit percentage. By default, overcommit is set to 0.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At startup and every 24 hours, each cluster will make a DNS request to query
the latest StorageOS version and log if a new version is available.  The UI
will also notify administrators.  This check can be disabled by setting
&lt;code&gt;DISABLE_TELEMETRY=true&lt;/code&gt;.  For more information see
&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/v1.x/docs/reference/telemetry/&#34;&gt;telemetry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since data scrub operations can be intensive, we now limit to 5 concurrent
volume scrubs.  This does not affect the number of volumes that may be deleted
in a batch as the scrubs occur asyncronously.  Volumes will remain in
&lt;code&gt;deleted&lt;/code&gt; state until the data is scrubbed, then they will not be reported at
all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;improved-10&#34;&gt;Improved&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updated Prometheus metrics names to follow best practices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added process name to dataplane log messages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removed excessive heartbeat messages from debug logging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removed an unneeded mutex from the dataplane debug logging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added protection against a potential hard hang while cleaning up devices by
instructing the kernel to abort any IO on the device prior to removing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add &lt;code&gt;createdAt&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;updatedAt&lt;/code&gt; fields in volume replica API objects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All API errors now return JSON content type (content remains the same).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UI improvements to remember state when validation fails.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UI feedback and help text while requesting a developer licence is more
intuitive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better error message when manually applying an invalid licence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volume detail page in the UI has numerous improvements to improve usability,
including on smaller screen sizes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the UI was accessed before the node was fully online it would show a
blank page. It now shows the message &lt;code&gt;Cluster API not yet available, waiting for nodes to join&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The browser &amp;ldquo;back&amp;rdquo; button on the UI now works as expected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Label management in the UI now gives context-sensitive examples and improves
validation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added network diagnostics and Prometheus metrics to support diagnostics
bundle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updated container labels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fixed-17&#34;&gt;Fixed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a replica is auto-promoted to master because the application container
moved, a cache reset for the volume is now triggered prior to updating the
presentation to ensure the cache can never serve stale data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed a crash in the replication server during shutdown when a volume scrub
operation was taking place on a deleted volume with a non-trivial amount of
data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a cluster with hundreds of volumes and nodes continuously rebooting, a race
condition could cause a volume to be &amp;ldquo;stuck&amp;rdquo; in syncing state if the sync
started before the dataplane was ready for operation.  New replicas are now
created with their health set to &lt;code&gt;provisioned&lt;/code&gt;, and only enter the &lt;code&gt;syncing&lt;/code&gt;
state once the sync is underway. This allows the operation to be retried if
required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After a restart, a write pointer was starting at the end of the current 64MB
chunk. This would waste space if the chunk was not fully used. The pointer
is now set to the end of the written data to ensure full utilisation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check-and-set operations in the internal key-value store library were not
honouring the TTL requested. This could cause CAS updates to fail when there
was above average latency between nodes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a non-admin user tried to cordon/drain a node in the UI it would fail
silently. Now the action is disabled for non-admins and the API returns the
correct error.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the UI, if a previous licensing operation failed, cached data could make it
difficult to re-request a licence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a volume was requested but failed due to validation (e.g. not enough
capacity), it would be marked as &lt;code&gt;failed&lt;/code&gt; and an attempt to re-create would
fail with the message &lt;code&gt;Volume with name &#39;foo&#39; already exists&lt;/code&gt;. Now the second
operation will replace the first and will be re-evaluated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After startup, pool capacity would only be calculated after the API was ready
for use.  This caused provisioning requests immediately after startup to fail.
Capacity is now calculated prior to the API accepting provisioning requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slow/broken DNS responses could cause cloud provider detection to delay
startup for up to 30 seconds while waiting for a timeout.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cluster health CLI and API endpoint no longer report an error when external
etcd is used for the KV store.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When creating new users, usernames are now validated to disallow names in the
UUID format used internally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the UI, non-admin users can now view and update their information,
including changing their own password.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Password resets now work correctly and can be used to create a licence for a
portal account that was created with a social login.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there was an error deleting a rule, the API returned an Internal Server
Error rather than a more helpful contextual error.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;100-rc5---released-20181001&#34;&gt;1.0.0-rc5 - Released 2018/10/01&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.0.0-rc5 is a major update, with multiple bug fixes, performance and usability
improvements as we get closer to removing the RC label.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;breaking-changes-1&#34;&gt;Breaking changes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Between rc4 and rc5 the location of the lock that governs configuration
changes has moved.  For maximum safety, shutdown StorageOS on all nodes
prior to upgrading to rc5.  If this is not feasible, contact
&lt;a href=&#34;mailto:support@storageos.com&#34;&gt;support@storageos.com&lt;/a&gt; for further instructions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prometheus metric names and types have changed to adhere to best practices.
If you have existing dashboards they will need to be updated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;new-10&#34;&gt;New&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User, group and policy management added to the Web UI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A custom or self-hosted cluster discovery service can now be specified by
setting the &lt;code&gt;DISCOVERY_HOST&lt;/code&gt; environment variable to the hostname or ip of the
running service.  The source code for the discovery service is open and
available on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/storageos/discovery&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.  Note that the
cluster discovery service is optional and supplied as a convenience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;KV_ADDR&lt;/code&gt; environment variable now supports specifying multiple hostnames
or addresses of external etcd servers.  Hostnames and addresses should be
comma-separated and can include the port number (required if not &lt;code&gt;2379&lt;/code&gt;, the
etcd default).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passes CSI 0.3 (latest) &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/csi-test&#34;&gt;conformance tests&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RHEL/Centos has a limit of 256 devices per HBA.  The API now returns
&lt;code&gt;cannot create new volume, active volumes at maximum&lt;/code&gt; when this limit has been
reached.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New network connectivity diagnostics to help diagnose potential firewall
issues.  With the CLI (&lt;code&gt;storageos cluster connectivity&lt;/code&gt;) or API
(&lt;code&gt;GET /v1/diagnostics/network&lt;/code&gt;), all required connectivity will be verified.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Without a licence, StorageOS has all features enabled but provisioned capacity
is now limited to 100GB.  Once registered (for free, via the Web UI), capacity
increases to 500GB.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;improved-11&#34;&gt;Improved&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased overall performance by reducing context switches in the IO path,
resulting in lower latency for all IO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased replication performance by optimising the parallel writes to
multiple destinations.  With &amp;gt;1 replicas this will roughly double replication
performance, but it also reduces the overhead of adding additional replicas to
a volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time taken to detect and recover from a node failure reduced from 45-70
seconds to &amp;lt;15 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improved the internal distributed lock mechanism to ensure correct and
deterministic behaviour in the majority of failure scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implemented basic check-and-set (CAS) on control plane operations where
consistency is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop all control plane state evaluations if KV store is unavailable for more
than the distributed lock TTL (5 seconds).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ensure node does not participate in state evaluations when it has been set as
unschedulable with &lt;code&gt;storageos node cordon&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;storageos node drain&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internal library change from &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hashicorp/serf&#34;&gt;Serf&lt;/a&gt; to
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hashicorp/memberlist&#34;&gt;Memberlist&lt;/a&gt;.  This helps simplify
node failure detection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Control plane state evaluations are now performed serially with an interval of
once per second.  This reduces the load on the cluster during bulk or recovery
operations.  Previously, multiple workers may try to apply the same changes,
causing unnessessary validation to take place.  A Prometheus histogram has
been added to track duration of each state evaluation.  Under normal operation
it takes 10-50ms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Node capacity now includes capacity from all devices made available for use by
StorageOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volume health management and reporting is improved.  Health is now defined as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;healthy&lt;/code&gt;: Only if the volume master and requested number of replicas are
healthy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;syncing&lt;/code&gt;: If any replicas are in the process of re-syncing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;suspect&lt;/code&gt;: The master is healthy, but at least one replica is suspect or
degraded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;degraded&lt;/code&gt;: If the master is suspect/degraded or the master is healthy
but at least one replica is dead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;offline&lt;/code&gt;: If the volume is offline, typically because the master is not
available and there were no healthy replicas to failover to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;decommissioned&lt;/code&gt;: If a volume is being deleted the health will be marked as
decommissioned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prometheus metrics have been overhauled to provide more friendly and useful
statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internal library change from &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/pagekit/vue-resource&#34;&gt;vue-resource&lt;/a&gt;
(&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/the-vue-point/retiring-vue-resource-871a82880af4&#34;&gt;deprecation notice&lt;/a&gt;)
to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/axios/axios&#34;&gt;Axios&lt;/a&gt; for handling ajax requests in the
Web UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warnings are now logged when volumes can not be provisioned due to licensing
constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internal logging improvements to ensure that runtime changes to log levels or
filters maintain consistency across multiple consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diagnostic requests now support JSON requests via the &amp;ldquo;Accepts&amp;rdquo; header,
defaulting to the current tar archive response.  Internally, collection from
multiple nodes is now streamed with a timeout of 10 seconds to prevent an
unresponsive node from blocking the response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improved description and flow of cluster diagnostics upload.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web UI volume detail page re-designed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web UI theme tweaks: list view, pagination, headers, in-place edit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upgrade version of internal messaging library (nats) and restructure
implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ensure the API supports label selectors on all object listings and improve
internal code consistency and tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ensure control plane workers and gRPC connection pool are shutdown cleanly
prior to shutting down the data plane to ensure operations have completed and
to reduce warnings in logs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explicitly shutdown the data plane gRPC handlers in the replication client
prior to shutting down the rest of the data plane.  This protects against a
potential issue that could lead to unclean shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lun ID is now computed dynamically.  This allows support for devices
across multiple HBAs in the future, which will remove the limitation of
256 volumes on RHEL7/Centos7 clusters and other systems with kernel 3.x.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SCSI lun support now supports co-existence with other block storage providers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulk volume creation could cause excessive validation warning messages in the
logs do to concurrent configuration requests to the data plane.  Now, if the
volume already exists or a CAS update fails, a conflict error (rather than
generic error) is returned to the control plane.  This allows the control
plane to only log a warning or error message if the intended action failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ongoing log message readability and tuning of log levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fixed-18&#34;&gt;Fixed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Filesystems now behave correctly when the underlying data store is out of
capacity.  Previously the filesystem would appear to hang as it would retry
the operation indefinitely.  Now, the filesystem will receive a fatal error
and will typically become read-only.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Listing volumes bypassed policy evaluation so a user in one namespace was able
to view volume details in another namespace.  Create, update and delete were
not affected and required correct authorization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deletion of encrypted volumes did not work correctly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Product version details were not always displayed correctly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Licence upload could fail with error: &lt;code&gt;licence and actual array UUIDs do not match&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Erroneously reported an error when removing data for a volume that was already
deleted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web UI icons no longer load from the Internet and now display in disconnected
environments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web UI capacity now uses gigabytes to be consistent with CLI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;API error when running &lt;code&gt;storageos cluster health&lt;/code&gt; was suggesting to use
&lt;code&gt;storageos cluster health&lt;/code&gt; to diagnose the errror.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;API for retrieving the Cluster ID is no longer restricted to administrators
only, but any authenticated user.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rules against namespaces with common prefixes no longer clash.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was possible to create more than one namespace with the same name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed &lt;code&gt;fork/exec /usr/sbin/symmetra: text file busy&lt;/code&gt;, caused by the operating
system not having closed the file for writing before it is executed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed &lt;code&gt;docker volume rm &amp;lt;volname&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; returning 0 but not deleting the volume
correctly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a volume has a single replica and the master fails when the replica is in
&lt;code&gt;syncing&lt;/code&gt; state, the volume is now marked as &lt;code&gt;offline&lt;/code&gt; until the master
recovers.  Previously, the volume remained in &lt;code&gt;syncing&lt;/code&gt; state indefinitely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a volume with no replicas goes offline and then recovers, the volume was
not marked as &lt;code&gt;healthy&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CLI was reporting replicas that were not active, creating inaccurate
volume counts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On a new volume with no replicas with the master on node1, if the volume was
mounted on a node that does not hold the volume master (node2) and then node1
drained, then the new volume created on another node will not be mountable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prometheus &lt;code&gt;/metrics&lt;/code&gt; endpoint always returns text format with correct text
encoding, even if binary output was requested.  This matches the Prometheus
2.0 policy to deprecate the binary format, and allows the endpoint to work
with other collectors that support the text format, e.g. Telegraf.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed an unclean shutdown issue in the data plane volume presentation where
configuration of a volume could still be attempted while a shutdown was in
progress.  A lock is now taken to ensure order and to refuse configuration
while a shutdown is in progress.  This only occured during shutdown and did
not affect data consistency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed an unclean shutdown issue in the replication client where references to
the client configuration could be cleared while IO was still in progress.  A
reference counter has been implemented to ensure that all operations have
completed prior to the server entry being removed.  This only occured during
shutdown and did not affect data consistency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure all internal IO acknowledgements are received or a timeout reached
prior to shutting down the replication server.  This fixes an issue where
a shutdown or fatal error could cause the server to crash as it was being
shutdown cleanly.  This only occured during shutdown and did not affect data
consistency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed an issue in the replication client connection handler that in some
situations could allow the client to re-use a connection while it was still
being prepared for re-use.  This could lead to a replication error or volumes
stuck in &amp;ldquo;syncing&amp;rdquo; state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No longer logs an error when deleting a volume with no data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;100-rc4---released-20180718&#34;&gt;1.0.0-rc4 - Released 2018/07/18&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple bug fixes and improvements, and improved shutdown handling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;new-11&#34;&gt;New&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Available capacity is now used in volume placement decisions.  This should
allow for a more even distribution of capacity across the cluster, especially
in clusters with large volumes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Licenses can now be applied from the Web UI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;improved-12&#34;&gt;Improved&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The shutdown process has been improved within the data plane, speeding up
the removal of devices and reducing the risk that the container runtime or
orchestrator will forcefully stop StorageOS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IO operations on volumes being deleted now return a fatal error so that the
operation is not retried and can fail immediately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During node filtering for volume scheduling decisions, it was possible to
return duplicate nodes as candidates for the volume placement.  This resulted
in slightly unbalanced placement across the cluster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volume replica removal didn&amp;rsquo;t prioritise syncing volumes over healthy.  This
meant that a fully-synced replica might be removed instead of one that is not
yet synced, in cases where the number of replicas was increased and then
immediately reduced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log verbosity has been reduced at info level.  Set &lt;code&gt;LOG_LEVEL=debug&lt;/code&gt; for more
verbose logging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fixed-19&#34;&gt;Fixed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UI labels overlapped when window resized in Firefox.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can now provision the licenced amount, rather than up to the licenced
amount fixing: &amp;ldquo;cannot provision volume with size 999 GB, currently
provisioned: 1 GB, licenced: 1000 GB&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;100-rc3---released-20180702&#34;&gt;1.0.0-rc3 - Released 2018/07/02&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple improvements based on customer feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;new-12&#34;&gt;New&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;StorageOS can now be installed alongside other storage products that make use
of the Linux SCSI Target driver.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CLI now checks for version compatibility with the API.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;improved-13&#34;&gt;Improved&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volume deletion now uses the scheduler&amp;rsquo;s desired state processing rather than
the previous imperative operation.  This fixes an issue where deletes could be
stuck in pending state if the scheduler loses state (e.g. from a restart)
while the operation is in progress.  Now the operation is idempotent and will
be retried until successful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volume placement now distributes volumes across nodes more evenly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSI version 0.3 (latest) is now fully supported.  Additionally, improvements
to CSI include how the default filesystem is determined, read-only mounts, and
better checking for volume capabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internal communication now times out after 5 seconds instead of 60.  This
allows retry or recovery steps to initiate much quicker than before.  This
timeout only affects inter-process communication on the same host, not over
the network to remote hosts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added a &amp;ldquo;degraded&amp;rdquo; state to the internal health monitoring.  This allows a
recovery period before marking a node offline, which then triggers a restart.
This improves stability when the KV store (internal or external) is undergoing
a leadership change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minor improvements to the UI notifications and error messages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upgraded controlplane compiler to Golang 10.0.3 (from 1.9.1).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fixed-20&#34;&gt;Fixed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online device resizing now works with SCSI devices.  Note that &lt;code&gt;resize2fs&lt;/code&gt;
still needs to be run manually on the filesystem, and we are working on making
this step automated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When deleting data from a volume, some metadata was not always being removed.
This meant that volumes with frequently changing data could use more capacity
than allocated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;100-rc2---released-20180531&#34;&gt;1.0.0-rc2 - Released 2018/05/31&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single fix to address provisioning issue in Amazon AWS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fixed-21&#34;&gt;Fixed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased time to wait for device to appear, causing volume creation to fail.
This was encountered on Xen-based RHEL/Centos VMs running in Amazon AWS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;100-rc1---released-20180525&#34;&gt;1.0.0-rc1 - Released 2018/05/25&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1.0 release series is focussed on supporting enterprise workloads, with
numerous new features and improvements to performance, stability and
maintainability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;breaking-changes-2&#34;&gt;Breaking changes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Several internal data structures were changed and are not compatible with
previous versions.  For this reason upgrades from version 0.10.x and earlier
are not supported.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The API endpoint &lt;code&gt;/v1/metrics&lt;/code&gt; has been replaced with &lt;code&gt;/metrics&lt;/code&gt; to conform
with Prometheus best practices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;new-13&#34;&gt;New&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volume presentation has changed to use the SCSI subsystem via the
Linux SCSI Target driver. Previous versions used NBD where available, or FUSE
where it wasn&amp;rsquo;t.  Using the new volume presentation improves performance on
the RHEL platform where NBD is not available.  This feature is available for
all major distributions and is widely used.  For more information, see
&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/v1.x/docs/prerequisites/systemconfiguration/&#34;&gt;system configuration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internally, the StorageOS scheduler has switched to using level-based state
handling and the gRPC protocol.  This allows the scheduler to make assertions
about the current state, rather than relying on events that can be missed.
The scheduler now behaves in the same way as Kubernetes controllers do; by
evaluating the current state, calculating adjustments, sharing desired state
and allowing individual components to apply differences.  For more information
on level triggered logic, see
&lt;a href=&#34;https://speakerdeck.com/thockin/edge-vs-level-triggered-logic&#34;&gt;Edge vs Level triggerd logic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encyption at-rest is available on a per-volume level by setting the label
&lt;code&gt;storageos.com/encryption=true&lt;/code&gt;.  In Kubernetes, volume encryption keys are
stored in Secrets.  Elsewhere, keys are stored in etcd, the key-value store
used internally within StorageOS.  No other configuration is required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Container Storage Interface (CSI) version 0.2 compatibility.  CSI is a
specification for storage providers that enables StorageOS to support any
orchestrator that supports CSI.  Currently this includes Kubernetes and
derivatives, Mesos and Docker.  Over time CSI will replace the native driver
in Kubernetes, though the existing v1 API will remain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple devices on a node can now be used, and StorageOS will shard data
across them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Node maintenance command such as &lt;code&gt;storageos node cordon&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;storageos node drain&lt;/code&gt; aid upgrades by live-migrating active volumes prior to node maintenance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Node labels can now be used for volume anti-affinity, allowing StorageOS to
make sure a master volume and its replicas are in separate failure domains.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloud provider failure domains are now auto-set as labels for nodes deployed
in Azure, AWS or GCE.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Administrators can download or upload to Storageos, support, cluster
information and log files.  This is currently only available via the Web
interfce or the API.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kubernetes mount option support (requires Kubernetes 1.10).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;improved-14&#34;&gt;Improved&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performance has improved significantly throughout and has been thoroughly
tested on a variety of workloads.  Specific areas include optimisations for
larger block sizes and improvements to the caching engine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volumes will go read-only shortly before the underlying device runs out of
space.  This allows the filesystem to handle errors gracefully and can protect
against corruption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pools have been overhauled to be dynamic, making use of label selectors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased number of volumes per node.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invalid labels now generate a validation error.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;storageos.com/&lt;/code&gt; namespaced labels must validate against known labels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fixed-22&#34;&gt;Fixed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mapping of compression and throttle labels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove hard connection limit on replication services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker ps&lt;/code&gt; shows unhealthy when everything is fine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Throttle impact was too small to be noticed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volume size &amp;lsquo;0&amp;rsquo; produced 10GB volume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Re-adding user to a group creates a duplicate entry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Node and pool capacity stats were sometimes wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;previous-releases&#34;&gt;Previous Releases&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;upgrades&#34;&gt;Upgrades&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to breaking changes between 0.9.x and 0.10.x upgrading is not possible.
Instead we recommend that you provision a new cluster and migrate data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please update to the latest CLI when installing 0.10.x.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;08x---09x&#34;&gt;0.8.x -&amp;gt; 0.9.x&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start-up scripts should be updated to use the new &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/v1.x/docs/reference/clusterdiscovery&#34;&gt;cluster
discovery&lt;/a&gt; syntax&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not mix a cluster with 0.8.x and 0.9.x versions as port numbers have changed.
This may cause cluster instability while nodes are being upgraded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;07x---08x&#34;&gt;0.7.x -&amp;gt; 0.8.x&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the nature the KV Store change there is no upgrade method from 0.7.x to
0.8.x+.  Our recommendation is to create a new cluster, paying attention to the
new parameters (&lt;code&gt;CLUSTER_ID&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;INITIAL_CLUSTER&lt;/code&gt;).  Note that &lt;code&gt;CLUSTER_ID&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;INITIAL_CLUSTER&lt;/code&gt; have been replaced by &lt;code&gt;JOIN&lt;/code&gt; in 0.9.x onwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;0100---released-20180228&#34;&gt;0.10.0 - Released 2018/02/28&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 0.10.0 version focusses on stability and usability as we get closer to GA,
but also adds a number of new features (UI, Prometheus metrics, log streaming).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;breaking-changes-3&#34;&gt;Breaking changes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took the decision to bundle as many known breaking changes into this release
in order to reduce pain later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The API endpoint &lt;code&gt;/v1/controllers&lt;/code&gt; has been replaced with &lt;code&gt;/v1/nodes&lt;/code&gt;.  This
removes the concept of storage controllers being different objects from
storage clients.  Now both are simply nodes, with the
&lt;code&gt;storageos.com/deployment&lt;/code&gt; label used to configure the deployment type.
Deployment types can be &lt;code&gt;computeonly&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;mixed&lt;/code&gt; are supported, with &lt;code&gt;mixed&lt;/code&gt;
being the default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Older versions of the CLI should be mostly backwards compatible but some
features such as node and pool capacity will not work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The label format for configuring StorageOS features has changed from
&lt;code&gt;storageos.feature.xyz&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;storageos.com/xyz&lt;/code&gt;.  This format is more familiar
to Kubernetes users.  Using the old format will still work until 0.11 when
conversion will be removed.  In 0.10 a deprecation notice will be issued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The environment variable used to add labels to nodes at startup time has
changed from &lt;code&gt;LABEL_ADD&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;LABELS&lt;/code&gt;.  Multiple labels can be comma-separated:
&lt;code&gt;LABELS=storageos.com/deployment=computeonly,region=us-west-1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;new-14&#34;&gt;New&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is now a Web interface, available on all cluster nodes on the API port
(&lt;code&gt;5705&lt;/code&gt;).  To access, point your web browser to http://ADVERTISE_IP:5705.
where ADVERTISE_IP is the public ip address of a StorageOS node.  Unless you
have changed the default credentials, login with user &lt;code&gt;storageos&lt;/code&gt;, password
&lt;code&gt;storageos&lt;/code&gt;.  See: https://docs.storageos.com/v1.x/docs/reference/gui/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prometheus stats are exported on each cluster node at
http://ADVERTISE_IP:5705/v1/metrics.  Prometheus 2.x is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CLI can now stream realtime logs from the active StorageOS cluster with
&lt;code&gt;storageos logs -f&lt;/code&gt;.  Logs are aggregated from all cluster nodes over a single
connection to the API.  Future releases will add support for filtering and
controlling the log level.  See: https://docs.storageos.com/v1.x/docs/reference/cli/logs/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The location of the StorageOS volumes can now be configured on a per-node
basis by setting the &lt;code&gt;DEVICE_DIR&lt;/code&gt; environment variable on the StorageOS node
container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is especially useful when running Kubernetes in a container
and you are unable or unwilling to share the default &lt;code&gt;/var/lib/storageos/volumes&lt;/code&gt;
location into the &lt;code&gt;kubelet&lt;/code&gt; container.  Instead, share the &lt;code&gt;kubelet&lt;/code&gt; plugin
directory into the StorageOS container, and set &lt;code&gt;DEVICE_DIR&lt;/code&gt; to use it.
Hovever, Kubernetes 1.10 will be required in order for &lt;code&gt;kubelet&lt;/code&gt; to use a
directory other than &lt;code&gt;/var/lib/storageos/volumes&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#000&#34;&gt;JOIN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ce5c00;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#204a87;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;storageos cluster create&lt;span style=&#34;color:#204a87;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
docker run --rm --name storageos &lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  -e HOSTNAME &lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  -e &lt;span style=&#34;color:#000&#34;&gt;DEVICE_DIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ce5c00;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;/var/lib/kubelet/plugins/kubernetes.io~storageos/devices &lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  -e &lt;span style=&#34;color:#000&#34;&gt;JOIN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ce5c00;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#000&#34;&gt;JOIN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  --pid host &lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  --privileged --cap-add SYS_ADMIN &lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  -v /var/lib/kubelet/plugins/kubernetes.io~storageos:/var/lib/kubelet/plugins/kubernetes.io~storageos:rshared &lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  --device /dev/fuse &lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  --net host &lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  storageos server
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;improved-15&#34;&gt;Improved&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;soft&lt;/code&gt; volume failure mode will now tolerate the replica being offline (for
example during a node reboot), if there is only one replica configured.  To
ensure there are always two copies of the data, use &lt;code&gt;hard&lt;/code&gt; mode with a single
replica, or use two replicas with &lt;code&gt;soft&lt;/code&gt; mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure volumes can only be mounted with the correct underlying filesystem.
You will now get a validation error if you try to mount an ext3 formatted
filesystem as ext4.  &lt;code&gt;ext4&lt;/code&gt; is the default if not specified when mounting an
unformatted volume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fixed-23&#34;&gt;Fixed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure cache is invalidated after mkfs.  Fixes mount error 32 that could occur
with Kubernetes or OpenShift on Centos/RHEL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memory leak in replication client led to excessive use over time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standardised all paths to 256 byte length to support user-configurable
&lt;code&gt;DEVICE_DIR&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed clean shutdown issue where filesystem could start new threads while
shutting down.  This was only observed in stress tests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shutdown signal handling improved, fixing &lt;code&gt;Transport endpoint is not connected&lt;/code&gt;
on Centos / RHEL in certain restart situations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;092&#34;&gt;0.9.2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 0.9.2 fixes a memory leak, so upgrading is recommended.  It also reduces
the time taken to delete volumes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More work has gone into logging, with API endpoints to control verbosity and
log filtering of running nodes individually or cluster-wide.  Version 0.9.4 of
the CLI provides the &lt;code&gt;storageos logs&lt;/code&gt; subcommand to control settings remotely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;new-15&#34;&gt;New&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;API endpoints for logging configuration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;improved-16&#34;&gt;Improved&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove cgo dependencies from controlplane&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better error message when the KV store is unavailable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduced memory footprint of controlplane by 67%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fixed-24&#34;&gt;Fixed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memory leak introduced in 0.9.0 fixed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;091&#34;&gt;0.9.1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 0.9.1 release includes a fix for the &lt;code&gt;mount deadline exceeded&lt;/code&gt; error, where
a volume mount fails after a long delay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The logging susbsystem has also been overhauled to reduce noise and to allow
filtering messages by log level and component.  We expect to build on this in
upcoming releases to further improve diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;new-16&#34;&gt;New&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Failure modes can be specified to control behaviour in specific failure
scenarios.  Full documentation to be added to the docs site soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;hard&lt;/code&gt; will enforce the desired number of replicas and take a volume offline
if the replica count is not met.  In practice, the volume should only go
offline if there isn&amp;rsquo;t a suitable node to place a new replica on.  For
example, if you have configured 2 replicas in a 3 node cluster and a node
goes offline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;alwayson&lt;/code&gt; will optimise for availability and will keep a volume online even
if all replicas have failed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;soft&lt;/code&gt; is set by default, and will only take a volume offline if the number
of replicas falls below the Failure tolerance (default: number of
replicas - 1).  This will allow a volume with 2 replicas in a 3 node cluster
to remain active while a node reboots.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can select the failure mode through the labels:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;storageos volume create --label storageos.com/replicas&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ce5c00;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#0000cf;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; --label storageos.com/failure.mode&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ce5c00;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;alwayson volume-name
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Log filtering allows finer-grained control of log messages so that debug-level
messages can be enabled only on some components.  Filtering is controlled by
setting &lt;code&gt;LOG_FILTER=cat1=level1,catN=LevelN&lt;/code&gt;.  For example, to enable
debugging on only the etcd category:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set &lt;code&gt;LOG_LEVEL=debug&lt;/code&gt; to enable debug logs.  This must be set to the lowest
level requested in the filter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set &lt;code&gt;LOG_FILTER=cp=info,dp=info,etcd=debug&lt;/code&gt; to set controlplane and
dataplane logs back to &lt;code&gt;info&lt;/code&gt; level, then &lt;code&gt;etcd&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;debug&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enabled profiling of the controlplane when DEBUG=true is set.  The endpoint is
availble at http://localhost:5705/debug/pprof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debug endpoints to monitor and control KV store leadership (DEBUG=true must be
set).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTTP GET on http://localhost:5705/debug/leader returns true/false if the
node is the cluster leader.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTTP PUT on http://localhost:5705/debug/leader/resign will cause leader to
resign, triggering a new election.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTTP PUT on http://localhost:5705/debug/leader/run will cause node to run
for cluster leadership.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These actions are used primarily for automated testing where we introduce
instability into the cluster to ensure there is no service disruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;improved-17&#34;&gt;Improved&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More instructive log messages if unable to create filesystem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve check for whether a device is using NBD for presentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log whenever a dataplane process restarts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updated etcd libraries to v3.3.0-rc.0.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Etcd tuning (TickMs = 200, ElectionMs = 5000)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updated other dependencies to latest stable releases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dataplane, etcd, gRPC and NATS now use same log format as the controlplane.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More user-friendly error message when &lt;code&gt;ADVERTISE_IP&lt;/code&gt; is invalid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fixed-25&#34;&gt;Fixed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed a bug that caused mounts to fail with &lt;code&gt;Failed to mount: exit status 32&lt;/code&gt;.
This was caused by the volume being marked as ready before the device was
fully initialised, and the mount starting before the initialization completed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volume names are no longer lowercased and keep the requested case.  This
fixes an issue with Docker EE with mixed-case volume names.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volume delete on non-existent volume now returns HTTP 404 instead of 500.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not reset node health if internal healthcheck returns invalid response.
Instead, retry and wait for valid response message.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;090---released-20171117&#34;&gt;0.9.0 - Released 2017/11/17&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release focusses on usability and backend improvements.  It builds on the
embedded KV store from 0.8.x and improves the bootstrap process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enhanced stress testing and performance benchmarking have also led to a number
of improvements and better failure handling and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;deprecation-notices&#34;&gt;Deprecation notices&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While in Beta there may be changes that break backwards compatibility.  GA
releases will strive to preserve compatibility between versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;INITIAL_CLUSTER&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;CLUSTER_ID&lt;/code&gt; environment variables have been
replaced with &lt;code&gt;JOIN&lt;/code&gt; and they should no longer be used to bootstrap a new
cluster.  &lt;code&gt;JOIN&lt;/code&gt; provides a more flexible mechanism for creating new clusters
and expanding existing clusters.  Errors or deprecation notices in the log at
startup will help verify that the correct environment variables are used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The API object format for users has changed to make it consistent with other
objects.  Version 0.9.0+ of the StorageOS CLI must be used to manage users on
a version 0.9.x cluster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;new-17&#34;&gt;New&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cluster can now start as soon as the first node starts, and any number of
nodes can join the cluster.  The &lt;code&gt;JOIN&lt;/code&gt; environment variable replaces
&lt;code&gt;CLUSTER_ID&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;INITIAL_CLUSTER&lt;/code&gt; and is more flexible, allowing
administrators to combine methods for bootstrapping and discovering clusters.
See &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/docs/install/reference/clusterdiscovery&#34;&gt;https://docs.storageos.com/docs/install/reference/clusterdiscovery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online replica sync for new and replacement replicas.  This allows for writes
to complete on the required number of replicas immediately instead of
waiting for a new replica or a replacement replica to be fully synced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Network ports now use a contiguous range (5701-5711/tcp, 5711/udp)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;State-tracker added to frontend filesystem.  This allows greater flexibilty
for backend failure recovery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prometheus endpoint for exposing internal metrics.  This version includes
API usage metrics, but will be extended in an upcoming release to include
detailed volume, pool and node metrics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reports are sent to Sentry if processes within the StorageOS container are
stopped unexpectantly.  These reports help us improve the stability of the
product, but they can be disabled by setting the setting the
&lt;code&gt;DISABLE_TELEMETRY&lt;/code&gt; environment variable to true.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;improved-18&#34;&gt;Improved&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enforced ordering for some types of read/write operations to ensure
deterministic behaviour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensured all components shutdown cleanly in normal situations and recover
properly when clean shutdown not done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added gRPC to dataplane for synchronous internal messaging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User API endpoint now has a format consistent with other endpoints.  &lt;code&gt;/users&lt;/code&gt;
now returns a list of users, and a POST/PUT to &lt;code&gt;/users/{id}&lt;/code&gt; accepts a user
object.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Document minimum server requirements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Document node selector for volume create operations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Document quality of service (QoS) and protection from noisy neighbors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Document volume placement hints&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Separate usage metric endpoints for internal (Dev/QA) and release (Public)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Health endpoints show &lt;code&gt;changedAt&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;updatedAt&lt;/code&gt; to help detect flapping
services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unmount volumes through CLI and API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removed false-postive errors and warning from logs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve signal handling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;LOG_LEVEL&lt;/code&gt; passed to dataplane components&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fixed-26&#34;&gt;Fixed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clear mount lock after ungraceful node shutdown&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;etcd error: &lt;code&gt;mvcc: database space exceeded&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NBD cleanup during ungraceful node shutdown&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No longer possible to have two default pools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;storageos cluster health&lt;/code&gt; did not return useful information while the cluster
was bootstrapping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Node master and replica statistics were not getting updated after a node
failure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;known-issues&#34;&gt;Known issues&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is currently not possible for a node to leave the cluster completely.  If
the StorageOS container is stopped and/or removed from a node then the node
will be detected as failed and it will be marked offline, but there is no way
to remove the node from the list.  &lt;code&gt;storageos node rm&lt;/code&gt; will be added before GA
along with &lt;code&gt;storageos node cordon&lt;/code&gt; to disable scheduling new volumes on the
node, and &lt;code&gt;storageos node drain&lt;/code&gt; to move volumes to other nodes prior to
maintenance or removing the node from the cluster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;storageos volume mount &amp;lt;vol&amp;gt; &amp;lt;mountpoint&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; does not work on Managed Plugin
installs.  Volumes mount into containers correctly using Docker.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Docker can only access volumes created in the &lt;code&gt;default&lt;/code&gt; namespace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clients mounting volumes from RHEL7/CentOS 7 will experience degraded
performance due to the absence of the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/v1.x/docs/prerequisites/systemconfiguration/&#34;&gt;NBD kernel module&lt;/a&gt;
on those platforms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;081&#34;&gt;0.8.1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;improved-19&#34;&gt;Improved&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NBD device numbers now start at 1 instead of 0 to defend against default values&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;080---released-20170829&#34;&gt;0.8.0 - Released 2017/08/29&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is our first feature release since launching our public beta, and it
focusses on feedback from users.  As always, please let us know how you are using
StorageOS, what problems it is solving for you and how it can improve.  Join our
&lt;a href=&#34;http://slack.storageos.com&#34;&gt;Slack channel!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;new-18&#34;&gt;New&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Embedded KV Store based on etcd to further simplify deployment and ongoing
cluster management.  Support for external Consul KV clusters has been
deprecated, though external etcd clusters are now possible, but not yet
documented and supported.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cluster discovery service to help bootstrap clusters.  Allocate a new cluster
with &lt;code&gt;storageos cluster create&lt;/code&gt; and pass the cluster identifier to each
StorageOS node in the &lt;code&gt;CLUSTER_ID&lt;/code&gt; environment variable to allow nodes to
discover the cluster without specifying hostnames or ip addresses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access control policies can restrict access to volumes and rules created
within a namespace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User and group management allows multiple users to be created and then used to
apply access policy by group membership or named account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anonymized usage metrics are collected and sent to StorageOS to help us better
understand usage patterns so we can focus our efforts accordingly.  Metrics
can be disabled by setting the &lt;code&gt;DISABLE_TELEMETRY&lt;/code&gt; environment variable to
&lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Location-based scheduling allows administrators to specify scheduling
constraints on volumes at creation time.  This provides a simple mechanism to
influence data placement.  (e.g. The volume&amp;rsquo;s data may only be stored on nodes
which have their environment label set to &lt;code&gt;production&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cluster health reporting with CLI (&lt;code&gt;storageos cluster health&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Selectors for rules&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use default namespace when not specified&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Once a 0.8.0 cluster has been established, it is currently not possible to add
or remove members.  We expect this functionality to come in 0.8.1, and welcome
feedback on how this should behave.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;storageos volume mount &amp;lt;vol&amp;gt; &amp;lt;mountpoint&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; does not work on Managed Plugin
installs.  Volumes mount into containers correctly using Docker.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Docker can only access volumes created in the &lt;code&gt;default&lt;/code&gt; namespace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clients mounting volumes from RHEL7/CentOS 7 will experience degraded
performance due to the absence of the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/v1.x/docs/prerequisites/systemconfiguration/&#34;&gt;NBD kernel module&lt;/a&gt;
on those platforms.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Docs: StorageOS Scheduler</title>
      <link>https://docs.storageos.com/v1.x/docs/reference/scheduler/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://docs.storageos.com/v1.x/docs/reference/scheduler/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;StorageOS has the capacity to influence Kubernetes Pod placement decisions to
ensure that Pods are scheduled on the same nodes as their data. This
functionality is known as &lt;code&gt;Pod Locality&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;StorageOS grants access to data by presenting, on local or remote nodes, the
devices used in a Pod&amp;rsquo;s VolumeMounts. However, it is often the case that it is
required or preferred to place the Pod on the node where the StorageOS Primary
Volume is located, because IO operations are fastest as a result of minimized
network traffic and associated latency. Read operations are served locally and
writes require fewer round trips to the replicas of the volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;StorageOS automatically enables the use of a custom scheduler for any Pod
using StorageOS Volumes. Checkout the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/v1.x/docs/reference/scheduler/admission-controller/&#34;&gt;Admission Controller reference&lt;/a&gt; for more
information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;storageos-kubernetes-scheduler&#34;&gt;Storageos Kubernetes Scheduler&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;StorageOS achieves Pod locality by implementing a Kubernetes scheduler
extender. The Kubernetes standard scheduler interacts with the StorageOS
scheduler when placement decisions need to be made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kubernetes standard scheduler selects a set of nodes for a placement
decision based on nodeSelectors, affinity rules, etc. This list of nodes is
sent to the StorageOS scheduler which sends back the target node where the Pod
shall be placed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The StorageOS scheduler logic is provided by a Pod in the Namespace where
StorageOS Pods are running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;scheduling-process&#34;&gt;Scheduling process&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a Pod needs to be scheduled, the scheduler collects information
about all available nodes and the requirements of the Pod. The collected
data is then passed through the Filter phase, during which the scheduler predicates
are applied to the node data to decide if the given nodes are compatible
with the Pod requirements. The result of the filter consists of a list of nodes
that are compatible for the given Pod and a list of nodes that aren&amp;rsquo;t
compatible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list of compatible nodes is then passed to the Prioritize phase, in which
the nodes are scored based on attributes such as the state. The result of the
Prioritize phase is a list of nodes with their respective scores. The more
favorable nodes get higher scores than less favorable nodes. The list is then
used by the scheduler to decide the final node to schedule the Pod on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a node has been selected, the third phase, Bind, handles the binding
of the Pod to the Kubernetes apiserver. Once bound, the kubelet on the node
provisions the Pod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The StorageOS scheduler implement Filter and Prioritization phases and leaves
binding to the default Kubernetes scheduler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;scheduling-rules&#34;&gt;Scheduling Rules&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The StorageOS scheduler filters nodes ensuring that the remaining subset
fulfill the following prerequisites:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The node is running StorageOS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The node is healthy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The node is not StorageOS Cordoned&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The node is not in a StorageOS Drained state&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The node is not a StorageOS compute-only node&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scoring protocol once the nodes are filtered is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Node with master volume - 15 points&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Node with replica volume - 10 points&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Node with no master or replica volume - 5 points&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Node with unhealthy volume or unsynced replica - 1 point&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;locality-modes&#34;&gt;Locality modes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two modes available to set pod locality for StorageOS Volumes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;preferred&#34;&gt;Preferred&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pod SHOULD be placed alongside its data, if possible. Otherwise, it will be
placed alongside volume replicas. If neither scenario is possible, the Pod
will start on another node and StorageOS will grant access to the
data over the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preferred mode is the default behaviour when using the StorageOS scheduler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;strict&#34;&gt;Strict&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pod MUST be placed alongside its data, i.e. on a node with the master
volume or a replica. If that is not possible, the Pod will remain in pending
state until the premise can be fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of strict mode is to provide the user with the capability to guarantee
best performance for applications. Some applications are required to give a
certain level of performance, and for such applications strict co-location of
application and data is essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, when running Kafka Pods under heavy load, it may be better to
avoid scheduling a Pod using a remote volume rather than have clients
direct traffic at a cluster member which exhibits degraded performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enable &lt;code&gt;preferred/strict&lt;/code&gt; modes by setting labels for your Pods. Checkout the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/v1.x/docs/reference/scheduler/examples/&#34;&gt;examples section&lt;/a&gt; for full
details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Locality Mode&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Label&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Preferred (Default)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;storageos.com/locality: preferred&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Best effort placement of the Pod along its StorageOS Volume&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Strict&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;storageos.com/locality: strict&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Enforce placement of the Pod alongside the Primary Volume or do not schedule&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

      <title>Docs: StorageOS Telemetry</title>
      <link>https://docs.storageos.com/v1.x/docs/reference/telemetry/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://docs.storageos.com/v1.x/docs/reference/telemetry/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;StorageOS collects telemetry and error reports  from StorageOS clusters via two
different methods for two different purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;telemetry&#34;&gt;Telemetry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Telemetry is made up of the DNS query and crash reports sent to sentry.io once per day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Error reporting is the sentry.io crash dump reporting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sentryio&#34;&gt;sentry.io&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;StorageOS sends crash reports and information about the StorageOS cluster to
&lt;a href=&#34;https://sentry.io&#34;&gt;sentry.io&lt;/a&gt;. This information helps our developers monitor
and fix crashes. Information is sent to sentry.io once per day or when a process inside the
StorageOS container crashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The once per day report includes the cluster version, node counts and license information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The crash report contains the signal that triggered the shutdown (e.g. SIGSEGV),
the exit code and whether or not the crash generated a core dump.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All StorageOS clusters with a routable connection to the internet will send crash
reports to sentry.io over tcp/443. StorageOS respects environment variables that
&lt;a href=&#34;https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#ProxyFromEnvironment&#34;&gt;ProxyFromEnvironment&lt;/a&gt;
uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An exhaustive list of information included in the once per day report is below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;API version&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cluster ID&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CPU architechture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go version&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Healthy volume count&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logging level&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logging user&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;License type&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Namespace count&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Node count&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pool count&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OS type&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rule count&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Server name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sentry version&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;StorageOS build information (CI pipeline reference)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;StorageOS version&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suspect volume count&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total volume size&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volume count&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volume degraded count&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volume offline count&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volume syncing count&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An exhaustive list of information included in the crash report is below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;API version&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cluster ID&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CPU architechture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crashed component name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Error level&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Error message&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exceptions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exit code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Datetime of crash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go version&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kernel signal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OS type&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;License type&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logging user&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Server name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stacktrace&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;StorageOS build information (CI pipeline reference)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;StorageOS version&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whether a core dump occured&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dns-query&#34;&gt;DNS Query&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;StorageOS will also send anonymized node ids, cluster id and StorageOS version
information to StorageOS using a DNS query. The information that we send in the
query is encoded as well as being anonymized. This query allows us to inform
Cluster admins when StorageOS upgrades are available in the StorageOS GUI and
in the logs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DNS query includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anonymized StorageOS Cluster ID&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anonymized StorageOS node ID&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;StorageOS version number&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If &lt;code&gt;k8sDistro&lt;/code&gt; is set then the Kubernetes version and Kubernetes distribution
will also be reported. This information helps us direct focus onto the most
relevant platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;disable-telemetry&#34;&gt;Disable Telemetry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible to disable telemetry using the CLI, API, environment
variables or the StorageOS Cluster Spec.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;api&#34;&gt;API&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The example below shows how you can use the /v1/telemetry API endpoint to disable or enable telemetry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;$ curl -X &lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;PUT&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;http://127.0.0.1:5705/v1/telemetry&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;         -H &lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;         -u &lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;storageos:storageos&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;                           &lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;         -d &lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;$&amp;#39;{
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;             &amp;#34;telemetryEnabled&amp;#34;: true,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;             &amp;#34;reportErrors&amp;#34;: false
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;         }&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;storageos-cluster-spec&#34;&gt;StorageOS Cluster Spec&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disable telemetry explicitly through the configurable &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/v1.x/docs/reference/cluster-operator/configuration/&#34;&gt;spec parameters&lt;/a&gt; of the StorageOSCluster custom resource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;environment-variables&#34;&gt;Environment Variables&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use the following environmental variables to disable or enable telemetry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;DISABLE_TELEMETRY       &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8f5902;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;# Disable the DNS query and once per day sentry.io reporting&lt;/span&gt;
DISABLE_ERROR_REPORTING &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8f5902;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;# Disable sentry.io crash reports&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find more information about StorageOS environment variables

        &lt;h2 id=&#34;host-filesystems&#34;&gt;Host Filesystems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;StorageOS will automatically use &lt;code&gt;/var/lib/storageos&lt;/code&gt; on each host as a base
directory for storing &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/v1.x/docs/concepts/volumes#blob-files&#34;&gt;configuration and blob
files&lt;/a&gt;. Supported host filesystem types
are &lt;code&gt;ext4&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;xfs&lt;/code&gt;. If you require a specific filesystem please &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/v1.x/docs/support/contactus&#34;&gt;contact
StorageOS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;persistent-volume-filesystems&#34;&gt;Persistent Volume Filesystems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;StorageOS provides a block device on which a file system can be created. The
creation of the filesystem is either handled by StorageOS or by Kubernetes
which affects what filesystems can be created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;csi-driver&#34;&gt;CSI Driver&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When using StorageOS with the CSI driver, StorageOS is responsible for running
mkfs against the block device that pods mount. StorageOS is able to create
ext2, ext3, ext4 and xfs file systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;native-driver&#34;&gt;Native Driver&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When using StorageOS with the native driver, Kubernetes is responsible for running mkfs
against the StorageOS block device. This means that any file system that Kubernetes can create
can be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However if the StorageOS CLI is used to mount a device then an ext4 filesystem
will be created by default.&lt;/p&gt;
