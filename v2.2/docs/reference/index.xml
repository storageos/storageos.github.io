        &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;storageos&lt;/code&gt; command line interface (CLI) is used to manage cluster-wide
configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8f5902;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;# linux/amd64&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will need to provide the correct credentials to connect to the API. The
default installation uses the &lt;code&gt;storageos-api&lt;/code&gt; Secret to generate the first
admin user. By default, it creates a single user with username &lt;code&gt;storageos&lt;/code&gt; and
password &lt;code&gt;storageos&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Docs: Cluster Operator</title>
      <link>https://docs.storageos.com/v2.2/docs/reference/cluster-operator/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://docs.storageos.com/v2.2/docs/reference/cluster-operator/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;Our cluster operator is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/extend-cluster/&#34;&gt;Kubernetes native
application&lt;/a&gt;
developed to deploy and configure StorageOS clusters, and assist with
maintenance operations. We recommend its use for standard installations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The operator acts as a Kubernetes controller that watches the &lt;code&gt;StorageOSCluster&lt;/code&gt;
CR (Custom Resource). Once the controller is ready, a StorageOS cluster definition can be
created. The operator will deploy a StorageOS cluster based on the
configuration specified in the cluster definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find the source code in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/storageos/cluster-operator&#34;&gt;cluster-operator
repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install the operator following orchestrator specific procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To deploy a StorageOS cluster you will need to fulfil the following steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install Etcd&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install operator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create &lt;code&gt;storageos-api&lt;/code&gt; Secret&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a CR (Custom Resource) to deploy StorageOS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Docs: Graphical user interface (GUI)</title>
      <link>https://docs.storageos.com/v2.2/docs/reference/gui/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

        &lt;p&gt;StorageOS provides a GUI for cluster and volume management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GUI is available at port 5705 on any of the nodes in the cluster. Initially
you can log in as the default administrator, with the username and password
from the &lt;code&gt;storageos-api&lt;/code&gt; Secret. By default &lt;code&gt;storageos&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;storageos&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can access the GUI by either port-forwarding with kubectl or using an
Ingress rule. i.e &lt;code&gt;kubectl -n kube-system port-forward svc/storageos 5705&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/v2.2/images/docs/gui-v2/login.png&#34; alt=&#34;Logging in&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;nodes&#34;&gt;Nodes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;volumes&#34;&gt;Volumes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can create volumes, including replicated volumes, and view volume details:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/v2.2/images/docs/gui-v2/volumes.png&#34; alt=&#34;Viewing storage volumes&#34;&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;namespaces&#34;&gt;Namespaces&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volumes can be namespaced across different projects or teams, and you can switch namespace using the left hand panel:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Docs: Init container</title>
      <link>https://docs.storageos.com/v2.2/docs/reference/init-container/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://docs.storageos.com/v2.2/docs/reference/init-container/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;StorageOS has requirements for the configuration of host systems. As such,
StorageOS starts an init container that sets the system configuration for
StorageOS. The container also manages configuration changes required when
upgrading StorageOS versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The container belongs to the DaemonSet that the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/v2.2/docs/reference/cluster-operator/&#34;&gt;StorageOS Cluster
Operator&lt;/a&gt; starts when a
&lt;code&gt;StorageOSCluster&lt;/code&gt; resource is created. The &lt;code&gt;storageos-init&lt;/code&gt; container is
executed as an
&lt;a href=&#34;https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/&#34;&gt;initContainer&lt;/a&gt;
as part of a Kubernetes Pod. Therefore, only successful execution of the
&lt;code&gt;storageos-init&lt;/code&gt; container processes will result in the main container
starting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;script-framework&#34;&gt;Script Framework&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code responsible for fulfilling the requirements is based on a Script
Framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The script framework executes a set of scripts, performing checks,
verifications and other procedures needed for StorageOS to be able to start.
The scripts stdout and stderr are written to the stdout and stderr of the init
app. The container logs contain all the logs of the individual scripts that
run. The exit statuses of the scripts are used to determine initialization
failure or success. Any non-zero exit status is logged as an event in the
Kubernetes Pod events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If any of the scripts fail, the &lt;code&gt;storageos-init&lt;/code&gt; container will propagate the
failure to Kubernetes, showing the status of the Pod as &lt;code&gt;Init:Err&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To view the output of all &lt;code&gt;storageos-init&lt;/code&gt; containers the following command can
be used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;kubectl -n kube-system logs -l &lt;span style=&#34;color:#000&#34;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ce5c00;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;storageos,kind&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ce5c00;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;daemonset -c storageos-init
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more details, check the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/storageos/init&#34;&gt;StorageOS init container project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;scripts-executed&#34;&gt;Scripts executed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;storageos-init&lt;/code&gt; container executes the following scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/storageos/init/tree/master/scripts/01-lio&#34;&gt;enable-lio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/storageos/init/tree/master/scripts/10-dbupgrade-v1v2&#34;&gt;dbupgrade&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Docs: StorageOS Feature labels</title>
      <link>https://docs.storageos.com/v2.2/docs/reference/labels/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://docs.storageos.com/v2.2/docs/reference/labels/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;Feature labels are a powerful and flexible way to control storage features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labels can be applied to various StorageOS artefacts. Applying specific feature
labels triggers compression, replication and other storage features. No feature
labels are present by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;storageos-node-labels&#34;&gt;StorageOS Node labels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nodes do not have any feature labels present by default.  When StorageOS is run
within Kubernetes, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/v2.2/docs/reference/cluster-operator/&#34;&gt;Cluster Operator&lt;/a&gt; syncs any node labels
set on Kubernetes nodes within StorageOS.  Node labels may also be set with the
CLI or UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Feature&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Label&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Values&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Compute only&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;storageos.com/computeonly&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;true / false&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Specifies whether a node should be &lt;code&gt;computeonly&lt;/code&gt; where it only acts as a client and does not host volume data locally, otherwise the node is hyperconverged (the default), where the node can operate in both client and server modes.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can set the computeonly label on the Kubernetes node and the label will be
sync&amp;rsquo;d to the StorageOS node (labels take an eventual consistency
reconciliation time of ~1min).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;kubectl label node &lt;span style=&#34;color:#000&#34;&gt;$NODE&lt;/span&gt; storageos.com/computeonly&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ce5c00;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#204a87&#34;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;storageos-volume-labels&#34;&gt;StorageOS Volume labels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volumes do not have any feature labels present by default. WARNING: The caching
and compression labels can only apply during provision time, they can&amp;rsquo;t be
changed during execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Feature&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Label&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Values&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Caching&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;storageos.com/nocache&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;true / false&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Switches off caching.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Compression&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;storageos.com/nocompress&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;true / false&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Switches off compression of data at rest and in transit.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Replication&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;storageos.com/replicas&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;integers [0, 5]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Replicates entire volume across nodes. Typically 1 replica is sufficient (2 copies of the data); more than 2 replicas is not recommended.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create a volume with a feature label:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Option 1: PVC Label&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add the label in the PVC definition, for instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34; data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#204a87;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;apiVersion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;v1&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#204a87;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;kind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;PersistentVolumeClaim&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#204a87;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;metadata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#204a87;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;pvc&lt;span style=&#34;color:#0000cf;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;-3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#204a87;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;labels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#204a87;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;storageos.com/replicas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;1&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8f5902;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;# Label &amp;lt;-----&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#204a87;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;spec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#204a87;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;storageClassName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;fast&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#204a87;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;accessModes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;- ReadWriteOnce&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#204a87;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;resources&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#204a87;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;requests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#204a87;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;storage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;1G&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Option 2: Set label in the StorageClass&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any PVC using the StorageClass inherits the label. The PVC label takes
precedence over the StorageClass parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34; data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#204a87;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;apiVersion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;storage.k8s.io/v1&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#204a87;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;kind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;StorageClass&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#204a87;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;metadata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#204a87;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;storageos-replicated&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#204a87;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;parameters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#204a87;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;csi.storage.k8s.io/fstype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;ext4&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#204a87;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;storageos.com/replicas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#4e9a06&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;1&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8f5902;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;# Label   &amp;lt;--------&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#204a87;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;provisioner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;storageos&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8f5902;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;# CSI driver (recommended) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f8f8f8;text-decoration:underline&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Option 3:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a PVC is created, you can update the Labels in StorageOS both in the
UI or CLI. Those labels are going to be visible only for StorageOS and will
not be synced to the Kubernetes resource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;A newly installed StorageOS cluster does not include a licence. A cluster can
run unlicensed for 24 hours. After that, new operations such as volume
provisioning or adding nodes are not permitted. Normal functioning of the
cluster can be unlocked by applying a Free Developer licence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn how to apply a licence to your cluster, check the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/v2.2/docs/operations/licensing/&#34;&gt;operations
licensing&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;free-developer-licence&#34;&gt;Free Developer licence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The developer licence only requires the user to register and issue a
licence through StorageOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The developer licence is free and grants a licence for a 5 node StorageOS
cluster with 5TB of provisioned capacity. It is designed to enable basic cloud
native workflows in Kubernetes that require the persistence of stateful
application data. Dynamic provisioning, distributed access to data and high
availability of volumes through synchronous replication and automatic failover
are some of the features that are available under the developer licence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The free developer licence includes community support through &lt;a href=&#34;https://slack.storageos.com&#34;&gt;our public Slack
channel.&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;commercial-licences&#34;&gt;Commercial licences&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For information on our commercial offerings, including support, please contact
&lt;a href=&#34;mailto:sales@storageos.com&#34;&gt;sales@storageos.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;note-about-capacity-limits&#34;&gt;Note about capacity limits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some StorageOS licences have limits on capacity. StorageOS allows provisioning
volumes until the limit of the licence is reached. Only the size of the volume
requested by the Persistent Volume Claim counts for the licence limit,
regardless whether of whether the volume has replication enabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the licence limit is reached, new volumes are not able to provision unless
provisioned capacity is released, i.e deleting volumes. That behaviour is not
tight to the capacity of the backend disks on your nodes.&lt;/p&gt;

   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
   as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
   meet the following conditions:

   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices

       the Derivative Works; and

   (d) If the Work includes a &amp;quot;NOTICE&amp;quot; text file as part of its
       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
       as modifying the License.

   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
   the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &amp;quot;AS IS&amp;quot; BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or

   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor

      source, and configuration files.

      &amp;quot;Object&amp;quot; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      &amp;quot;Work&amp;quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      &amp;quot;Derivative Works&amp;quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      &amp;quot;Contribution&amp;quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &amp;quot;submitted&amp;quot;
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as &amp;quot;Not a Contribution.&amp;quot;

      &amp;quot;Contributor&amp;quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a &amp;quot;NOTICE&amp;quot; text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &amp;quot;AS IS&amp;quot; BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      &amp;quot;License&amp;quot; shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      &amp;quot;Licensor&amp;quot; shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      &amp;quot;Legal Entity&amp;quot; shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      &amp;quot;control&amp;quot; means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      &amp;quot;Source&amp;quot; form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      &amp;quot;Object&amp;quot; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      &amp;quot;Work&amp;quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      &amp;quot;Derivative Works&amp;quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      &amp;quot;Contribution&amp;quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &amp;quot;submitted&amp;quot;
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as &amp;quot;Not a Contribution.&amp;quot;

      &amp;quot;Contributor&amp;quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a &amp;quot;NOTICE&amp;quot; text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &amp;quot;AS IS&amp;quot; BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

     Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
     non-exclusive license:

     a. under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
        Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
        modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
        Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as

     b. under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for
        sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions
        or its Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date

     The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become
     effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes
     such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

     The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this
     License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution
     or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section
     2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:

     a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or

     b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s
        modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
        Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
        Version); or

     c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its
        Contributions.

     This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or
     logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the
     notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

     No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
     distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License
     (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted
     under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

     Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions
     are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the
     rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

     This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable
     copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

     Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in
     Section 2.1.


3. Responsibilities

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

     All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
     Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the
     terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form
     of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how
     they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or
     restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
        of distribution to the recipient; and

     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,
        or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for
        the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’
        rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the
     Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software
     with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered
     Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits
     You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of
     such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at
     their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of
     either this License or such Secondary License(s).

3.4. Notices

     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including
     copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
     of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered
     Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent
     required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf
     of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
     warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You
     alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
     jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial
   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
   they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
   distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the
   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
   understand it.

5. Termination

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,
     if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.
     Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an
     ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by
     some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of
     non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become
     compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,
     and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or
     indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and
     all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License
     shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
     termination shall survive termination.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty

   Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without
   warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
   without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
   merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire
   risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.
   Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any
   Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or
   correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this
   License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License
   except under this disclaimer.

7. Limitation of Liability

   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
   party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
   Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

8. Litigation

   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of
   a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business
   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
   prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
   contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe
   this License against a Contributor.

        Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,

     are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the
     rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

3. Responsibilities

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

     All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
     Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the
     terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form
     of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how
     they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or
     restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
        of distribution to the recipient; and

     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,
        or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for
        the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’
        rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the
     Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software
     with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered
     Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits
     You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of
     such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at
     their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of
     either this License or such Secondary License(s).

3.4. Notices

     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including
     copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
     of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered
     Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent
     required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf
     of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
     warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You
     alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
     jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial
   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
   they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
   distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the
   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
   understand it.

5. Termination

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,
     if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.
     Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an
     ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by
     some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of
     non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become
     compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,
     and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or
     indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and
     all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License
     shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
     termination shall survive termination.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty

   Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without
   warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
   without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
   merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire
   risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.
   Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any
   Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or
   correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this
   License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License
   except under this disclaimer.

7. Limitation of Liability

   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
   party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
   Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

8. Litigation

   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of
   a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business
   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
   prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
   contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe
   this License against a Contributor.

     distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
     License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
     permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

     Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
     Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to
     grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

     This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
     applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
     equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

     Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in
     Section 2.1.


3. Responsibilities

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

     All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
     Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
     the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
     Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
     License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
     attempt to alter or restrict the recipients&#39; rights in the Source Code
     Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
        of distribution to the recipient; and

     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
        License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
        license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the
        recipients&#39; rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
     the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
     Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
     Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
     License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
     under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
     the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
     Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
     License(s).

3.4. Notices

     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
     (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or
     limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the
     Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the
     extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
     behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
     such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
     You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
     jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute,
   judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of
   this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
   limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a
   text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under
   this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation,
   such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary
   skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing
     basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by
     some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into
     compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are
     reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the
     non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have
     received notice of non-compliance with this License from such
     Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt
     of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
     counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
     directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
     You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
     2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
     termination shall survive termination.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty

   Covered Software is provided under this License on an &amp;quot;as is&amp;quot; basis,
   without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory,
   including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free
   of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing.
   The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software
   is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect,
   You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,
   repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential
   part of this License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under
   this License except under this disclaimer.

7. Limitation of Liability

   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from
   such party&#39;s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such
   limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
   incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may
   not apply to You.

8. Litigation

   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts
   of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of
   business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
   jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing
   in this Section shall prevent a party&#39;s ability to bring cross-claims or
   counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
   matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
   unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
   necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that
   the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not
   be used to construe this License against a Contributor.


10. Versions of the License

10.1. New Versions

      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
      10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
      publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a

      steward.

10.3. Modified Versions

      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
      create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
      modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
      any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
      such modified license differs from this License).

10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
      Licenses If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is

        Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,

        modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
        Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
        Version); or

     c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its
        Contributions.

     This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or
     logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the
     notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

     No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to

     (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted
     under the terms of Section 3.3).

     Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions
     are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the
     rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

     This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable
     copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.

3. Responsibilities

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

     All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
     Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the
     terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form
     of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how
     they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or
     restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
        of distribution to the recipient; and

     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,
        or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for
        the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’
        rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the
     Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software
     with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered
     Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits
     You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of
     such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at
     their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of
     either this License or such Secondary License(s).

3.4. Notices

     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including
     copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
     of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered
     Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent
     required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf
     of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
     warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You
     alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
     jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial
   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
   they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
   distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the
   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
   understand it.

5. Termination

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,
     if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.
     Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an
     ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by
     some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of
     non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become
     compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,
     and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or
     indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and
     all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License
     shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
     termination shall survive termination.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty

   Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without
   warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
   without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
   merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire
   risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.
   Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any
   Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or
   correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this
   License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License
   except under this disclaimer.

7. Limitation of Liability

   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
   party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
   Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

8. Litigation

   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of
   a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business
   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
   prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
   contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe
   this License against a Contributor.

      steward.

10.3. Modified Versions

      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
      create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified
      version of this License if you rename the license and remove any
      references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such
      modified license differs from this License).

     non-exclusive license:

     a. under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
        Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
        modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
        Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as
        part of a Larger Work; and

     b. under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for
        sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions
        or its Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date

     effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes
     such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

     The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this
     License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution
     or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section
     2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:

     a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or

     b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s
        modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
        Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
        Version); or

     c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its
        Contributions.

     This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or
     logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the
     notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

     No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
     distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License
     (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted
     under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

     Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions
     are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the
     rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

     This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable
     copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

     Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in
     Section 2.1.


3. Responsibilities

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

     All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
     Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the
     terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form
     of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how
     they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or
     restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
        of distribution to the recipient; and

     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,
        or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for
        the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’
        rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the
     Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software
     with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered
     Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits
     You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of
     such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at
     their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of
     either this License or such Secondary License(s).

3.4. Notices

     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including
     copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
     of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered
     Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent
     required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf
     of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
     warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You
     alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
     jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial
   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
   they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
   distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the
   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
   understand it.

5. Termination

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,
     if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.
     Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an
     ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by
     some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of
     non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become
     compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,
     and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or
     indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and
     all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License
     shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
     termination shall survive termination.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty

   Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without
   warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
   without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
   merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire
   risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.
   Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any
   Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or
   correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this
   License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License
   except under this disclaimer.

7. Limitation of Liability

   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
   party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
   Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

8. Litigation

   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of
   a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business
   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
   prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
   contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe
   this License against a Contributor.

     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,
     if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some

     Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an
     ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,

   risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.
   Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any
   Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or
   correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this
   License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License

   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all

   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
   party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
   Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
   prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

   contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe
   this License against a Contributor.

     Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
     non-exclusive license:

     a. under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
        Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
        modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
        Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as

     effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes
     such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

     License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution
     or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section
     2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:

     a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or

     b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s
        modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
        Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
        Version); or

     c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its
        Contributions.

     This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or
     logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the
     notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

     No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
     distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License
     (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted
     under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

     Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions
     are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the
     rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

     This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable
     copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

     Section 2.1.


3. Responsibilities

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

     All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
     Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the
     terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form
     of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how
     they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or
     restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
        of distribution to the recipient; and

     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,
        or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for
        the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’
        rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the
     Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software
     with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered
     Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits
     You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of
     such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at
     their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of
     either this License or such Secondary License(s).

3.4. Notices

     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including
     copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
     of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered
     Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent
     required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf
     of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
     warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You
     alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
     jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial
   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
   they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
   distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the
   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
   understand it.

5. Termination

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,
     if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.
     Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an
     ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by
     some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of
     non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become
     compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,
     and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or
     indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and
     all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License
     shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
     termination shall survive termination.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty

   Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without
   warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
   without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
   merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire
   risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.
   Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any
   Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or
   correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this
   License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License
   except under this disclaimer.

7. Limitation of Liability

   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
   party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
   Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

8. Litigation

   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of
   a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business
   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
   prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
   contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe
   this License against a Contributor.


10. Versions of the License

10.1. New Versions

      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
      10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
      publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
      distinguishing version number.

10.2. Effect of New Versions

      You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of
      the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or
      under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
      steward.

10.3. Modified Versions

      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
      create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified
      version of this License if you rename the license and remove any
      references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such
      modified license differs from this License).

     Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software
     with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered
     Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits
     You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of
     such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at
     their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of
     either this License or such Secondary License(s).

3.4. Notices

     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including
     copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
     of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered
     Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent
     required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf
     of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
     warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You
     alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
     jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial
   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
   they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
   distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the
   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
   understand it.

5. Termination

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,
     if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.
     Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an
     ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by
     some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of
     non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become
     compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,
     and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or
     indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and
     all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License
     shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
     termination shall survive termination.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty

   Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without
   warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
   without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
   merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire
   risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.
   Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any
   Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or
   correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this
   License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License
   except under this disclaimer.

7. Limitation of Liability

   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
   party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
   Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

8. Litigation

   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of
   a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business
   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
   prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
   contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe
   this License against a Contributor.


10. Versions of the License

10.1. New Versions

      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
      10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
      publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
      distinguishing version number.

10.2. Effect of New Versions

      You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of
      the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or
      under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
      steward.

10.3. Modified Versions

      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
      create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified
      version of this License if you rename the license and remove any
      references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such
      modified license differs from this License).

10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses
      If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
      Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
      notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.

Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice

      This Source Code Form is subject to the
      terms of the Mozilla Public License, v.
      2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not
      distributed with this file, You can
      obtain one at
      http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.

If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then
You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant
directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.

You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

Exhibit B - “Incompatible With Secondary Licenses” Notice

      This Source Code Form is “Incompatible
      With Secondary Licenses”, as defined by
      the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.

      <title>Docs: Release notes</title>
      <link>https://docs.storageos.com/v2.2/docs/reference/release_notes/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://docs.storageos.com/v2.2/docs/reference/release_notes/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;We recommend always using &amp;ldquo;tagged&amp;rdquo; versions of StorageOS rather than &amp;ldquo;latest&amp;rdquo;,
and to perform upgrades only after reading the release notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest tagged release is &lt;code&gt;v2.2.0&lt;/code&gt;. For
installation instructions please see our
&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/v2.2/docs/reference/cluster-operator/install&#34;&gt;Install&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest CLI release is &lt;code&gt;v2.2.0&lt;/code&gt;, available from
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/storageos/go-cli/releases&#34;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;upgrading&#34;&gt;Upgrading&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To upgrade from version 1.x to 2.x, please contact &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/v2.2/docs/support/&#34;&gt;support&lt;/a&gt; for assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;v220---released-2020-08-18&#34;&gt;v2.2.0 - Released 2020-08-18&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release focuses on performance. We analysed existing performance
characteristics across a variety of real-world use cases and ended up with
improvements across the board. Of particular note:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sequential reads have improved by up to 130%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sequential writes have improved by up to 737%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Random reads have improved by up to 45%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Random writes have improved by up to 135%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I/O for large block sizes (128K) has improved by up to 353%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are extremely proud of our performance and we love to talk about it. Have a
look at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/v2.2/docs/self-eval/#Benchmarking&#34;&gt;Benchmarking&lt;/a&gt; section of the self-evaluation guide and consider sharing
your results. Our PRE engineers are available to discuss in our &lt;a href=&#34;https://storageos.slack.com&#34;&gt;slack
channel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;new&#34;&gt;New&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data engine revamp focused on provable consistency and performance. Key
characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Metadata is stored in an optimised index, lowering I/O latency and improving
performance for all workloads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Large block reads/writes are now be handled in a single operation.
Applications like Kafka will go much faster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On-disk compression is now disabled by default as in most scenarios this
offers better performance. To enable on-disk compression for a specific
workload, see &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/v2.2/docs/concepts/compression&#34;&gt;compression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;improved&#34;&gt;Improved&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dataplane: The number of I/O threads are now determined by the number of
processing cores available.  This improves scalability and performance on
larger servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ha: Improve partition tolerance behaviour when a volume master that has lost
its connection to etcd rejoins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ha: Allow replicas in unhealthy states to be remediated and re-used while
maintaining partition tolerance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ha: When a master fails and the new master is not yet available, introduce a
back-off to the redirection logic to avoid spamming the logs with connection
failure errors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ha: Ignore health advertisements for local node. Local nodes are handled
directly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;node delete: Only refuse to delete a node if the node health can be
authoritatively verified to be in use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;api: Increase HTTP server write timeout.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cli/ui: Allow partial diagnostic bundle downloads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ui: Namespace dropdown can now be scrolled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ui: Add &amp;ldquo;Job title&amp;rdquo; to UI licence form.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;logging: Log version at startup at INFO level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;logging: Lower verbosity of SCSI warnings that do not apply to StorageOS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;diagnostics: Include logs that have been rotated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;diagnostics: Bundle collection across providers is now done in parallel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;build: Update base image to RHEL 8.2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;operator: Removed DB migration utility required for v1.3 -&amp;gt; v1.4 upgrades.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;operator: Automatically refreshes StorageOS API token without failing
requests when the token expires.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;operator: Updated CSI attacher and provisioner to latest upstream.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;operator: Remove &lt;code&gt;cluster.local&lt;/code&gt; suffix on Pod scheduler service address.
This allows the scheduler to work in clusters with custom DNS configuration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;operator: Defaults are now set for most CSI configuration options in the
StorageOSCluster custom resource.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fixed&#34;&gt;Fixed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;csi: When unmount request is received for a volume that has already been
unmounted, return success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;csi: Verify volume is attached on the node before mounting it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;xfs: Support older RHEL kernels which have an XFS library that does not
allow reflinks/dedupe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dataplane: Reserve 1GiB of capacity on the target disk to allow manual cleanup
operations, rather than filling target disk to capacity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;operator: In some cases &lt;code&gt;/var/lib/storageos&lt;/code&gt; could fail to unmount cleanly
after a restart. This resulted in multiple entries in &lt;code&gt;/proc/mounts&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;v210---released-2020-06-26&#34;&gt;v2.1.0 - Released 2020-06-26&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;new-1&#34;&gt;New&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;csi: Volume expansion now supported in offline mode. To expand a volume,
stop any workloads accessing the volume, then edit the PVC to increase the
capacity. For more information, see our &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/v2.2/docs/operations/resize&#34;&gt;Volume
Resize&lt;/a&gt; operations page and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/volume-expansion.html&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;CSI Volume Expansion&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;api: Volume configuration including replica count can now be updated while
the volume is in use. Other updateable fields include labels and
description.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;failover: Before determining that a node is offline and performing recovery
operations, the I/O path is also verified. This provides more robust failure
detection and ensures that nodes that are still responding to I/O do not get
replaced. This I/O path verification is in addition to the gossip-based
failure detection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;operator: Default tolerations are now set for the StorageOS node container.
This helps ensure that the StorageOS node container does not get evicted when
the node is running low on resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;improved-1&#34;&gt;Improved&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;api: Added checks to prevent deletion of a node with active volumes, or if it
is the master of at least one volume. This helps prevent orphaned volumes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cli: Add an &lt;code&gt;--offline-delete&lt;/code&gt; flag to allow removal of volumes whose master
and replica nodes are offline. This allows cleanup of orphaned volumes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ui: Add an offline volume delete option.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ui: Volumes can now be detached from the UI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cli: Labels are no longer truncated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;api: When a new node is added to the cluster, its capacity is available to use
immediately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fixed-1&#34;&gt;Fixed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ui: Favicon was missing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ui: Duplicate volumes could be shown on the node details page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;operator: During uninstall a ClusterRoleBinding was not removed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;v200---released-2020-05-05&#34;&gt;v2.0.0 - Released 2020-05-05&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;new-2&#34;&gt;New&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;operator: StorageOS containers now run in the &lt;code&gt;kube-system&lt;/code&gt; namespace by
default to allow the &lt;code&gt;system-node-critical&lt;/code&gt; priority class to be set. This
instructs Kubernetes to start StorageOS before application Pods, and to evict
StorageOS only after application Pods have finished. This setting was
previously recommended in documentation; it is now the default.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;operator: StorageOS CSI helper containers now run as privileged. This ensures
that the CSI endpoint can be seen on systems with SELinux enabled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ui: replication progress for new or re-joining replicas is now displayed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ui: show warning for unlicensed clusters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cli: new commands:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;licence management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;get policy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create namespace&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create policy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;describe user&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;describe namespace&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;describe policy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;delete user&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;delete namespace&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;delete policy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;licence: removed the default licence expiry date added for &lt;code&gt;v2.0.0-rc.1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;improved-2&#34;&gt;Improved&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dataplane: improved retry behaviour for network I/O.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cli: &amp;ldquo;get volumes&amp;rdquo; for all namespaces should be done in parallel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cli: help text document config file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ui: link node name and get to node details on the volume details page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ui: node details add available capacity spinner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ui: node list remove capacity values / address port.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ui: node list show master/replica counts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ui: node list remove edit action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ui: format entity labels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ui: node details link volumes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ui: align buttons for licences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ui: k8s warning in &amp;ldquo;create volume&amp;rdquo; modal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ui: node list remove &amp;ldquo;API&amp;rdquo; from &amp;ldquo;API Address&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ui: add some details about the Licence on the licence page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;api: include valid for duration in login response.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;licence: restrict nodes which are unregistered after 24 hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;scheduler: return error for namespace/volume not found&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dataplane: start gRPC threads separately from rest of the supervisor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fixed-2&#34;&gt;Fixed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ui: centre licence types.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ui: capacity in ui is per namespace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cli: fail gracefully if missing some output details (i.e. no node exists for id).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;v200-rc1---released-2020-03-31&#34;&gt;v2.0.0-rc.1 - Released 2020-03-31&lt;/h2&gt;

      <title>Docs: Resource Requests and Limits</title>
      <link>https://docs.storageos.com/v2.2/docs/reference/resource_requests_and_limits/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://docs.storageos.com/v2.2/docs/reference/resource_requests_and_limits/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;h2 id=&#34;managing-resources-for-storageos-containers&#34;&gt;Managing Resources for StorageOS containers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes resource requests and limits are two optional Pod properties that
allow you to specify how much of a resource a container in a Pod needs or can
use. They are two main resources that you can specify requests and limits for,
CPU and Memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As StorageOS is an infrastructure component, the health of other applications
depends on being able to write to the StorageOS volumes. As such it is of
paramount importance to avoid restarts of the StorageOS DaemonSet Pods.
Restarting a StorageOS Pod results in the volumes of the node the StorageOS Pod
is running on being marked as Read Only, and causes the failover of primary
volumes on that node to their replicas. After a StorageOS Pod restart, once the
StorageOS DaemonSet Pod is &amp;ldquo;READY&amp;rdquo;, the application Pods running on the node
need to be restarted in order to trigger a mount of the filesystem hosted on
the StorageOS volume and resume normal operations. To avoid restarts of the
StorageOS main container by Kubernetes due to resource limits being reached, it
is recommended to not set resource limits on the StorageOS DaemonSet. In
addition to avoiding resource limits, StorageOS uses a &lt;a href=&#34;https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/pod-priority-preemption/#priorityclass&#34;&gt;high priority
class&lt;/a&gt;
when the DaemonSet is installed in the &amp;lsquo;kube-system&amp;rsquo; namespace. That avoids the
DaemonSet Pods of being evicted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information about managing resources for containers please see the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/&#34;&gt;Kubernetes
documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Docs: StorageOS Telemetry</title>
      <link>https://docs.storageos.com/v2.2/docs/reference/telemetry/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://docs.storageos.com/v2.2/docs/reference/telemetry/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;StorageOS collects telemetry and error reports from StorageOS clusters via two
different methods for two different purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;telemetry&#34;&gt;Telemetry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Telemetry is made up a DNS version check query and a once per day report.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Error reporting is the sentry.io crash dump reporting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sentryio&#34;&gt;sentry.io&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;StorageOS sends crash reports to &lt;a href=&#34;https://sentry.io&#34;&gt;sentry.io&lt;/a&gt;. This
information helps our developers monitor and fix crashes. Information is sent
to sentry.io when a process inside the StorageOS container
crashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The crash report contains the signal that triggered the shutdown (e.g. SIGSEGV),
the exit code and whether or not the crash generated a core dump.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All StorageOS clusters with a routable connection to the internet will send crash
reports to sentry.io over tcp/443. StorageOS respects environment variables that
&lt;a href=&#34;https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#ProxyFromEnvironment&#34;&gt;ProxyFromEnvironment&lt;/a&gt;
uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An exhaustive list of information included in the crash report is below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;StorageOS version&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crash description string&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anonymized Cluster ID&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anonymized Node ID&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dns-query&#34;&gt;DNS Query&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;StorageOS will perform a &amp;ldquo;latest version check&amp;rdquo; using a DNS query in order to
inform administrators that a new version is available. StorageOS will also send
anonymized node ids, cluster id and StorageOS version information to StorageOS
using a DNS query. The information that we send in the query is encoded as well
as being anonymized. This query allows us to inform Cluster admins when
StorageOS upgrades are available in the StorageOS GUI and in the logs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DNS query includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anonymized StorageOS Cluster ID&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anonymized StorageOS node ID&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;StorageOS version number&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;once-per-day-report&#34;&gt;Once Per Day Report&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The once per day report contains information about the StorageOS cluster and
Kubernetes versions to help StorageOS focus our development efforts on the most
popular platforms. The once per day data is encrypted and sent to a StorageOS
telemetry server so it is never processed outside of StorageOS assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An exhaustive list of information included in the once per day report is below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;api_call_metrics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cluster_disable_crash_reporting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cluster_disable_version_check&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cluster_log_format&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cluster_log_level&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cluster_tls_provided&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;k8s_distribution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;k8s_in_k8s&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;volume_master_provision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volume_master_recover_replica&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volume_master_trigger_rejoin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volume_metrics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volume_placement_strategy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volume_provision_source_user_agent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volume_replica_delete_deployment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volume_replica_failover_deployment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volume_replica_promote&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volume_replica_provision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volume_replicas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volume_replica_trigger_rejoin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volume_size_bytes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;disable-telemetry&#34;&gt;Disable Telemetry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible to disable telemetry using the GUI, CLI, API, environment
variables or the StorageOS Cluster Spec.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;storageos-cluster-spec&#34;&gt;StorageOS Cluster Spec&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disable telemetry explicitly through the configurable &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/v2.2/docs/reference/cluster-operator/configuration/&#34;&gt;spec parameters&lt;/a&gt; of the
StorageOSCluster custom resource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;environment-variables&#34;&gt;Environment Variables&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use the following environmental variables to disable or enable telemetry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;DISABLE_VERSION_CHECK   &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8f5902;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;# Disable the DNS version check&lt;/span&gt;
DISABLE_TELEMETRY       &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8f5902;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;# Disable the once per day reporting&lt;/span&gt;
DISABLE_ERROR_REPORTING &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8f5902;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;# Disable sentry.io crash reports&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Docs: Support bundle</title>
      <link>https://docs.storageos.com/v2.2/docs/reference/bundle/</link>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;StorageOS can generate a cluster diagnostic bundle from the GUI or CLI under
user request. The bundle packages the information needed for the engineering
team to understand the context of your cluster and begin troubleshooting any
issues you may be experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;generate-bundle&#34;&gt;Generate Bundle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cli&#34;&gt;CLI&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/v2.2/docs/reference/cli/&#34;&gt;StorageOS CLI&lt;/a&gt; can generate
the bundle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;$ storageos get diagnostics
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file generated is in the form of &lt;code&gt;diagnostics-${TIME_STAMP}.gz&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;gui&#34;&gt;GUI&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or you can use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/v2.2/docs/reference/gui/&#34;&gt;StoregeOS GUI&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to section &amp;ldquo;Cluster&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press the button &amp;ldquo;DOWNLOAD DIAGNOSTICS&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;data-collected-in-the-bundle&#34;&gt;Data collected in the bundle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the data collected in the bundle is regarding the state of the
StorageOS cluster, however some other information regarding the infrastructure
is also gathered. The information is used to have a clear view of the cluster
where StorageOS is running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bundle incorporates for each node:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;StorageOS Daemonset Pod logs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lshw&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dmesg (kernel logs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;StorageOS metadata for the ControlPlane and DataPlane&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;storageos-metadata-collected&#34;&gt;StorageOS metadata collected&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cluster metadata&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;namespaces metadata&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nodes metadata&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volumes metadata&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;capacity stats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;environment variables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;health&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;privacy&#34;&gt;Privacy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;StorageOS can only obtain the bundle if it is downloaded by the user and given
to our engineering team, or uploaded for analysis. The data received by
StorageOS is private and never leaves nor will leave StorageOS Inc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data contained in the cluster diagnostic bundle has the sole purpose of
helping customers troubleshoot their issues.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Docs: Supported File systems</title>
      <link>https://docs.storageos.com/v2.2/docs/reference/filesystems/</link>

        &lt;h2 id=&#34;host-filesystems&#34;&gt;Host Filesystems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;StorageOS will automatically use &lt;code&gt;/var/lib/storageos&lt;/code&gt; on each host as a base
directory for storing &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/v2.2/docs/concepts/volumes#blob-files&#34;&gt;configuration and blob
files&lt;/a&gt;. Supported host filesystem types
are &lt;code&gt;ext4&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;xfs&lt;/code&gt;. If you require a specific filesystem please &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.storageos.com/v2.2/docs/support/contactus&#34;&gt;contact
StorageOS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;persistent-volume-filesystems&#34;&gt;Persistent Volume Filesystems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;StorageOS provides a block device on which a file system can be created. The
creation of the filesystem is either handled by StorageOS or by Kubernetes
which affects what filesystems can be created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;csi-driver&#34;&gt;CSI Driver&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When using StorageOS with the CSI driver, StorageOS is responsible for running
mkfs against the block device that pods mount. StorageOS is able to create
ext2, ext3, ext4 and xfs file systems.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Docs: Tolerations</title>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;h2 id=&#34;kubernetes-tolerations&#34;&gt;Kubernetes Tolerations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tolerations are a Kubernetes pod property that allow pods to tolerate certain
node taints. Taints can be thought of as the opposite of Node affinity in that
taints repel pods. Node taints are automatically applied by Kubernetes in
response to node resources coming under contention. As StorageOS provides
storage to pods it should not be evicted during periods of resource contention,
as any pods using StorageOS volumes on the same node would need to be
restarted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As StorageOS runs as a daemonset some Kubernetes tolerations are added by
Kubernetes while others are automatically added by the StorageOS operator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information about tolerations please see the &lt;a href=&#34;https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/&#34;&gt;Kubernetes
documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
